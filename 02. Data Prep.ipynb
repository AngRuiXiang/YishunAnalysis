SINGAPORE - A 19-year-old woman, Miss Felicia Teo Wei Ling, was last seen leaving for work 19 days ago. Described as 1.6m tall, slim, slightly tanned, and with short, black hair, she had left for work from her Block 233, Bain Street flat at 6pm on June 29. Lianhe Wanbao reported last week that Miss Teo had told her family that she would be attending a friend's wedding on June 30. However, she did not turn up at the wedding. Her brother, 18-year-old Teo Wei De, told Lianhe Wanbao that his sister was a final-year student at Lasalle College of the Arts. Since her disappearance, 100 friends and relatives have been searching her favourite hangouts, including Marine Parade, Clarke Quay and East Coast. Yesterday, police appealed for anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact them on 1800-255-0000.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - The Prime Minister has an official residence at the Istana? Sri Temasek, a just-restored colonial bungalow in the Istana domain, has piqued curiosity since Mr Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message there last Friday. Built in 1869 for the then-colony secretary, it remains today the official residence of the Singapore prime minister. But none of the three PMs - Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Goh Chok Tong or Mr Lee Hsien Loong - has made it his home. Instead, Sri Temasek stars silently at official functions and tells the story of Singapore's early diplomatic life. Foreign leaders near and far were hosted on its intimate premises, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them was \"the Father of Malaysia\", the late Tunku Abdul Rahman. The late Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi dropped in too, as did Jordan's King Hussein and US Vice-President Spiro Agnew in the Nixon days. Lord Denis Healey, the defence secretary who announced the 1968 British troop withdrawal from Singapore, was pictured there wielding chopsticks at a small dinner while then-PM Lee Kuan Yew looked on, bemused. In 1962, Mr Lee hosted a party to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore's merger with Malaysia. In 1983, the body of the late finance minister Hon Sui Sen lay in state for a couple of days at the stately two-storey building for people to pay their last respects. The bungalow was built by Major J. F. A. McNair, a civil engineer who also had a hand in the soaring Gothic design of St Andrew's Cathedral. Designed in an East-West style, the red-roofed Sri Temasek is 1,600 sq m, and distinguished by arches. For some years, the national monument fell into disrepair and was not used. It was mostly restored this March, and will be used for small state functions. The Straits Times viewed Sri Temasek yesterday with architects from CPG Consultants, the firm restoring it. Senior architect Maureen Soh highlighted the Western symmetry in its layout. Eastern elements are present in the Malay eaves. Carved Chinese \"breeze blocks\" with cut-out designs set into the wrap-around verandas let in lots of fresh air. The 2m-wide verandas shade people from the brutal tropical sun. Said Ms Soh, who first saw Sri Temasek in 2004: \"It was rundown. But I felt more for the building as I worked on it. \"It is a simple building but has special features such as tiers of arches and columns,\" she added. Set serenely on a knoll, Sri Temasek overlooks lush gardens, and there are glimpses of the city skyline. In the 1998 book, The Man And His Ideas, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is reported saying that his three children were seven, five and two when he became PM in 1959. He and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek. He said: \"We did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs.\" The family stayed there only briefly in 1965 - for security reasons, amid the turmoil of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Mr Lee Hsien Loong too decided not to make Sri Temasek his home when he became PM in 2004. Still, the family would have fond memories of the grounds. The three children ran around in the evening, \"while Kuan Yew played golf or practised on the practice tee and the putting green\", Madam Kwa said in a Straits Times interview in 2000. These unspoken historical and personal reasons may have prompted the choice of Sri Temasek as the setting for this year's National Day message.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This story was first published on April 5, 2010 The greatest distance to cover in any race is the distance between your ears. Strength does not come from physical capability, but from an indomitable will. So says Yong Yuen Cheng, fastest finisher of the 218-km Run Round Singapore in 31hr 28min 51sec. Of course, many people think he has lost whatever was between his ears, judging by the distance - equivalent to more than five marathons - he covered on March 28 to mark Nanyang Technological University's 55th anniversary. Why would anyone want to put themselves through an experience littered with low points like cramps, diarrhoea, dislodged toenails, blisters, heat, sleepiness and excruciating leg pain - and end up in a wheelchair after? Crazy! Yong, 38, agrees. \"If one is not well-trained, conditioned, prepared, experienced or supported,\" says the ultra-runner, who is in the business of logic (he is a Hwa Chong Institution physics teacher), \"then yes, running 218km is crazy.\" But he will tell you that he built up his mileage gradually since last May, down to the nitty-gritties of date, distance and time (his reply took a full page). Races and other organised mass running events doubled up as long training runs - a good way of \"setting short-term goals in terms of preparation\", he says. Twice - in the span of two weeks at the end of last year - he ran five marathons in five days to condition his body to the 218km distance. He will tell you that he is neither a fast nor talented runner. In his Secondary 1 fitness test, he took more than 16min to run 2.4km. In his first road race as a 17-year-old student at National Junior College, the school canoeist came in 148th. He trained his heart out the next year, but managed only 24th. His first marathon in 1992 is his fastest to date (3hr 52min). It was only at the 2004 MR25 Ultramarathon, where he ran 84km in 10hr 36min and was fifth, that he realised he was \"not bad\" at ultras. To those who still don't understand why Yong does what he does, he will tell you he was a sickly child. In Primary 2, he weighed just 19kg, in P6, just 26kg (the average boy would be 40kg by then). Running for him is a blessing. \"Actually, I expected little from the run in terms of placing because I know how much slower I am compared with most of the other runners,\" says Yong, who rested just one day before going back to work last Tuesday. \"But I feel lucky that this has become a good lesson for my students.\" And, that is, that anyone can achieve the extraordinary.

       "      <td>Twelve-year-old Jordan Foo received a belated birthday gift on Wednesday: a coveted place in the finals of a nationwide search for Singapore's best speller. The Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) pupil will slug it out with 28 others from other schools at the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship finals next Saturday. The group of finalists - the largest number to date - represent the top spellers here and were whittled down from a pool of 1,200 contestants who took part in the preliminary rounds. Jordan, who turned 12 on Tuesday, had tripped on \"eking\" in round seven, but he said he kept his hopes up despite not winning in the zone. Only the four zonal winners were guaranteed a place, while the others were ranked nationally by the Ministry of Education (MOE).Natasha Lee, 10, thought she would not stand a chance as she was axed in round six, tripping on the word \"sacrosanct\". So when her mum, teacher Cecilia Ow, 42, broke the news that she was in the finals, the first thing the Primary 5 pupil from Xinghua Primary School uttered was: \"No... Really?\" \"I didn't believe my mum. It was so shocking. I didn't think I would get in,\" she said. Though she has a Scrabble competition on the same day, Natasha said she is picking the spelling competition because \"my heart says spelling\". \"I want to do the spelling because I put in a lot of hard work,\" she said. Besides working on her words, she will try to avoid falling ill ahead of next week's championship. At the finals, pupils will have to spell their given words orally in front of a 500-strong audience. Utter one wrong letter and they will be out. However, they may get help by asking questions such as what the word's language of origin is or what the definition is - all within a 60-second time limit. Madam Halimah Yacob, the Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports, will be the guest of honour at the event, to be held at the Raffles City Convention Centre. Bragging rights aside, Singapore's champion speller will win $5,000 and a trophy, while his or her school will take the challenge trophy. This is the first year RHB Banking Group and The Straits Times have teamed up to organise the event, which is held in partnership with MOE. serl@sph.com.sg</td>\n",

       "      <td>Why celebrate a spelling champ in the digital age</td>\n",
       "      <td>Competitive spelling is a mind sport. Like watching any sportsman demonstrate excellence by besting another, it offers a glimpse of human drama at its most sublime. I sat on a judging panel last weekend, gripped by Singapore's top young spellers during the zonal rounds of the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship. I cheered inwardly when a child got a word right, his face lighting up with the satisfaction of a runner having cleared his heats. Far harder was watching the crushing blow of a misspelled word and the ensuing tears. But I am convinced: To say that we do not need to spell well in a digital age of countless technological checks is to say we don't need the Olympics because there are Xbox simulations of sports. Expert spellers demonstrate technical ability worthy of a national platform. The skill of holding a lengthy, often illogical string of letters in your head, then articulating them in their correct sequence, is a feat that calls for memory, study, strategy, intelligence and, most importantly, nerves of steel. In a strong speller you will see not only an understanding of the definition of a word, but also its precise application. Such an expert is likely to be able to express that he is not merely happy, but describe exactly the degree of his elation, exuberance and felicity. This may be why witnessing a young mind trying to discern how many 'Ls' there are in \"dilettante\", if \"eking\" contains another \"e\", or if \"odyssey\" needs an \"i\" or \"y\", is so addictive. You get to see how widely the speller has read, his command of semantics, and how deeply he loves the language. No English language learner can be an exponent without mastery of spelling, in the same way no one can be a tennis champ without the ability to serve. What a competition like The Big Spell does is deepen the appreciation of what a young English expert is capable of under pressure, without any help from the Internet. To give the curious a sense of just how tough spelling can be, I quizzed several adults on selected words from the 50 featured in the competition's preliminary round. Can you spell \"berserk\", I asked. How about \"menagerie\"? Now, \"diphtheria\". Not one of the 20 people I asked got all three correct. Some said flatly: \"No, I cannot. I use Google.\" Others said: \"I can do it if I can write it down on paper.\" Or: \"Who says diphtheria has an extra 'h'?\" And: \"You didn't even pronounce the word correctly!\" Then the sheepish admission: \"Actually, this is quite hard.\" Unlike the child competitors of The Big Spell, my peers and I, I fear, have been neglecting our fundamentals. Having drunk from the fountain of autocorrect, we have become spoiled, slack, uninterested - and worse, unabashed about it. Educators rightly fret about the impact of the digital age on language skills. Pervasive technology is creating a paradox that they daily battle: At no point in history have young people done more writing by composing texts, exchanging e-mail and instant messages, and posting on social networks. Yet few regard their informal communication as \"real\" writing, so they employ the lowest grades of language. Truncations, lax punctuation, acronyms, IM speak, slang and bad grammar are everywhere. So reliant are we now on software that delivers us from errors and even feeds us synonyms, that our confidence in our own language skills is eroding. Unlike champion spellers, adults no longer take pride in getting a word spelt right, or feel shame at getting it wrong. We expect some magical digital check to clean up the mess. Unfortunately, without a healthy respect for the foundational elements of a language, experts believe, we can never develop a deep understanding of its heritage and culture. How can we ever love it fully, they say, when we cannot claim to know it intimately? A platform that celebrates spelling in this era helps to keep standards from falling. It challenges English language learners to strive for expertise and be the best they can be. As for us adults, maybe it's time we started thinking of a grown-up version of the game. sereneg@sph.com.sg</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – An elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – The man behind one of Singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on Wednesday. Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

SINGAPORE - A 19-year-old woman, Miss Felicia Teo Wei Ling, was last seen leaving for work 19 days ago. Described as 1.6m tall, slim, slightly tanned, and with short, black hair, she had left for work from her Block 233, Bain Street flat at 6pm on June 29. Lianhe Wanbao reported last week that Miss Teo had told her family that she would be attending a friend's wedding on June 30. However, she did not turn up at the wedding. Her brother, 18-year-old Teo Wei De, told Lianhe Wanbao that his sister was a final-year student at Lasalle College of the Arts. Since her disappearance, 100 friends and relatives have been searching her favourite hangouts, including Marine Parade, Clarke Quay and East Coast. Yesterday, police appealed for anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact them on 1800-255-0000.   \n",

Sri Temasek, a just-restored colonial bungalow in the Istana domain, has piqued curiosity since Mr Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message there last Friday. Built in 1869 for the then-colony secretary, it remains today the official residence of the Singapore prime minister. But none of the three PMs - Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Goh Chok Tong or Mr Lee Hsien Loong - has made it his home. Instead, Sri Temasek stars silently at official functions and tells the story of Singapore's early diplomatic life. Foreign leaders near and far were hosted on its intimate premises, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them was \"the Father of Malaysia\", the late Tunku Abdul Rahman. The late Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi dropped in too, as did Jordan's King Hussein and US Vice-President Spiro Agnew in the Nixon days. Lord Denis Healey, the defence secretary who announced the 1968 British troop withdrawal from Singapore, was pictured there wielding chopsticks at a small dinner while then-PM Lee Kuan Yew looked on, bemused. In 1962, Mr Lee hosted a party to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore's merger with Malaysia. In 1983, the body of the late finance minister Hon Sui Sen lay in state for a couple of days at the stately two-storey building for people to pay their last respects. The bungalow was built by Major J. F. A. McNair, a civil engineer who also had a hand in the soaring Gothic design of St Andrew's Cathedral. Designed in an East-West style, the red-roofed Sri Temasek is 1,600 sq m, and distinguished by arches. For some years, the national monument fell into disrepair and was not used. It was mostly restored this March, and will be used for small state functions. The Straits Times viewed Sri Temasek yesterday with architects from CPG Consultants, the firm restoring it. Senior architect Maureen Soh highlighted the Western symmetry in its layout. Eastern elements are present in the Malay eaves. Carved Chinese \"breeze blocks\" with cut-out designs set into the wrap-around verandas let in lots of fresh air. The 2m-wide verandas shade people from the brutal tropical sun. Said Ms Soh, who first saw Sri Temasek in 2004: \"It was rundown. But I felt more for the building as I worked on it. \"It is a simple building but has special features such as tiers of arches and columns,\" she added. Set serenely on a knoll, Sri Temasek overlooks lush gardens, and there are glimpses of the city skyline. In the 1998 book, The Man And His Ideas, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is reported saying that his three children were seven, five and two when he became PM in 1959. He and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek. He said: \"We did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs.\" The family stayed there only briefly in 1965 - for security reasons, amid the turmoil of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Mr Lee Hsien Loong too decided not to make Sri Temasek his home when he became PM in 2004. Still, the family would have fond memories of the grounds. The three children ran around in the evening, \"while Kuan Yew played golf or practised on the practice tee and the putting green\", Madam Kwa said in a Straits Times interview in 2000. These unspoken historical and personal reasons may have prompted the choice of Sri Temasek as the setting for this year's National Day message.   \n",

Strength does not come from physical capability, but from an indomitable will. So says Yong Yuen Cheng, fastest finisher of the 218-km Run Round Singapore in 31hr 28min 51sec. Of course, many people think he has lost whatever was between his ears, judging by the distance - equivalent to more than five marathons - he covered on March 28 to mark Nanyang Technological University's 55th anniversary. Why would anyone want to put themselves through an experience littered with low points like cramps, diarrhoea, dislodged toenails, blisters, heat, sleepiness and excruciating leg pain - and end up in a wheelchair after? Crazy! Yong, 38, agrees. \"If one is not well-trained, conditioned, prepared, experienced or supported,\" says the ultra-runner, who is in the business of logic (he is a Hwa Chong Institution physics teacher), \"then yes, running 218km is crazy.\" But he will tell you that he built up his mileage gradually since last May, down to the nitty-gritties of date, distance and time (his reply took a full page). Races and other organised mass running events doubled up as long training runs - a good way of \"setting short-term goals in terms of preparation\", he says. Twice - in the span of two weeks at the end of last year - he ran five marathons in five days to condition his body to the 218km distance. He will tell you that he is neither a fast nor talented runner. In his Secondary 1 fitness test, he took more than 16min to run 2.4km. In his first road race as a 17-year-old student at National Junior College, the school canoeist came in 148th. He trained his heart out the next year, but managed only 24th. His first marathon in 1992 is his fastest to date (3hr 52min). It was only at the 2004 MR25 Ultramarathon, where he ran 84km in 10hr 36min and was fifth, that he realised he was \"not bad\" at ultras. To those who still don't understand why Yong does what he does, he will tell you he was a sickly child. In Primary 2, he weighed just 19kg, in P6, just 26kg (the average boy would be 40kg by then). Running for him is a blessing. \"Actually, I expected little from the run in terms of placing because I know how much slower I am compared with most of the other runners,\" says Yong, who rested just one day before going back to work last Tuesday. \"But I feel lucky that this has become a good lesson for my students.\" And, that is, that anyone can achieve the extraordinary.

The Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) pupil will slug it out with 28 others from other schools at the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship finals next Saturday. The group of finalists - the largest number to date - represent the top spellers here and were whittled down from a pool of 1,200 contestants who took part in the preliminary rounds. Jordan, who turned 12 on Tuesday, had tripped on \"eking\" in round seven, but he said he kept his hopes up despite not winning in the zone. Only the four zonal winners were guaranteed a place, while the others were ranked nationally by the Ministry of Education (MOE).Natasha Lee, 10, thought she would not stand a chance as she was axed in round six, tripping on the word \"sacrosanct\". So when her mum, teacher Cecilia Ow, 42, broke the news that she was in the finals, the first thing the Primary 5 pupil from Xinghua Primary School uttered was: \"No... Really?\" \"I didn't believe my mum. It was so shocking. I didn't think I would get in,\" she said. Though she has a Scrabble competition on the same day, Natasha said she is picking the spelling competition because \"my heart says spelling\". \"I want to do the spelling because I put in a lot of hard work,\" she said. Besides working on her words, she will try to avoid falling ill ahead of next week's championship. At the finals, pupils will have to spell their given words orally in front of a 500-strong audience. Utter one wrong letter and they will be out. However, they may get help by asking questions such as what the word's language of origin is or what the definition is - all within a 60-second time limit. Madam Halimah Yacob, the Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports, will be the guest of honour at the event, to be held at the Raffles City Convention Centre. Bragging rights aside, Singapore's champion speller will win $5,000 and a trophy, while his or her school will take the challenge trophy. This is the first year RHB Banking Group and The Straits Times have teamed up to organise the event, which is held in partnership with MOE. serl@sph.com.sg   \n",

Like watching any sportsman demonstrate excellence by besting another, it offers a glimpse of human drama at its most sublime. I sat on a judging panel last weekend, gripped by Singapore's top young spellers during the zonal rounds of the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship. I cheered inwardly when a child got a word right, his face lighting up with the satisfaction of a runner having cleared his heats. Far harder was watching the crushing blow of a misspelled word and the ensuing tears. But I am convinced: To say that we do not need to spell well in a digital age of countless technological checks is to say we don't need the Olympics because there are Xbox simulations of sports. Expert spellers demonstrate technical ability worthy of a national platform. The skill of holding a lengthy, often illogical string of letters in your head, then articulating them in their correct sequence, is a feat that calls for memory, study, strategy, intelligence and, most importantly, nerves of steel. In a strong speller you will see not only an understanding of the definition of a word, but also its precise application. Such an expert is likely to be able to express that he is not merely happy, but describe exactly the degree of his elation, exuberance and felicity. This may be why witnessing a young mind trying to discern how many 'Ls' there are in \"dilettante\", if \"eking\" contains another \"e\", or if \"odyssey\" needs an \"i\" or \"y\", is so addictive. You get to see how widely the speller has read, his command of semantics, and how deeply he loves the language. No English language learner can be an exponent without mastery of spelling, in the same way no one can be a tennis champ without the ability to serve. What a competition like The Big Spell does is deepen the appreciation of what a young English expert is capable of under pressure, without any help from the Internet. To give the curious a sense of just how tough spelling can be, I quizzed several adults on selected words from the 50 featured in the competition's preliminary round. Can you spell \"berserk\", I asked. How about \"menagerie\"? Now, \"diphtheria\". Not one of the 20 people I asked got all three correct. Some said flatly: \"No, I cannot. I use Google.\" Others said: \"I can do it if I can write it down on paper.\" Or: \"Who says diphtheria has an extra 'h'?\" And: \"You didn't even pronounce the word correctly!\" Then the sheepish admission: \"Actually, this is quite hard.\" Unlike the child competitors of The Big Spell, my peers and I, I fear, have been neglecting our fundamentals. Having drunk from the fountain of autocorrect, we have become spoiled, slack, uninterested - and worse, unabashed about it. Educators rightly fret about the impact of the digital age on language skills. Pervasive technology is creating a paradox that they daily battle: At no point in history have young people done more writing by composing texts, exchanging e-mail and instant messages, and posting on social networks. Yet few regard their informal communication as \"real\" writing, so they employ the lowest grades of language. Truncations, lax punctuation, acronyms, IM speak, slang and bad grammar are everywhere. So reliant are we now on software that delivers us from errors and even feeds us synonyms, that our confidence in our own language skills is eroding. Unlike champion spellers, adults no longer take pride in getting a word spelt right, or feel shame at getting it wrong. We expect some magical digital check to clean up the mess. Unfortunately, without a healthy respect for the foundational elements of a language, experts believe, we can never develop a deep understanding of its heritage and culture. How can we ever love it fully, they say, when we cannot claim to know it intimately? A platform that celebrates spelling in this era helps to keep standards from falling. It challenges English language learners to strive for expertise and be the best they can be. As for us adults, maybe it's time we started thinking of a grown-up version of the game. sereneg@sph.com.sg   \n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).   \n",

Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "31247  SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

SINGAPORE - A 19-year-old woman, Miss Felicia Teo Wei Ling, was last seen leaving for work 19 days ago. Described as 1.6m tall, slim, slightly tanned, and with short, black hair, she had left for work from her Block 233, Bain Street flat at 6pm on June 29. Lianhe Wanbao reported last week that Miss Teo had told her family that she would be attending a friend's wedding on June 30. However, she did not turn up at the wedding. Her brother, 18-year-old Teo Wei De, told Lianhe Wanbao that his sister was a final-year student at Lasalle College of the Arts. Since her disappearance, 100 friends and relatives have been searching her favourite hangouts, including Marine Parade, Clarke Quay and East Coast. Yesterday, police appealed for anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact them on 1800-255-0000.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - The Prime Minister has an official residence at the Istana? Sri Temasek, a just-restored colonial bungalow in the Istana domain, has piqued curiosity since Mr Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message there last Friday. Built in 1869 for the then-colony secretary, it remains today the official residence of the Singapore prime minister. But none of the three PMs - Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Goh Chok Tong or Mr Lee Hsien Loong - has made it his home. Instead, Sri Temasek stars silently at official functions and tells the story of Singapore's early diplomatic life. Foreign leaders near and far were hosted on its intimate premises, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them was \"the Father of Malaysia\", the late Tunku Abdul Rahman. The late Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi dropped in too, as did Jordan's King Hussein and US Vice-President Spiro Agnew in the Nixon days. Lord Denis Healey, the defence secretary who announced the 1968 British troop withdrawal from Singapore, was pictured there wielding chopsticks at a small dinner while then-PM Lee Kuan Yew looked on, bemused. In 1962, Mr Lee hosted a party to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore's merger with Malaysia. In 1983, the body of the late finance minister Hon Sui Sen lay in state for a couple of days at the stately two-storey building for people to pay their last respects. The bungalow was built by Major J. F. A. McNair, a civil engineer who also had a hand in the soaring Gothic design of St Andrew's Cathedral. Designed in an East-West style, the red-roofed Sri Temasek is 1,600 sq m, and distinguished by arches. For some years, the national monument fell into disrepair and was not used. It was mostly restored this March, and will be used for small state functions. The Straits Times viewed Sri Temasek yesterday with architects from CPG Consultants, the firm restoring it. Senior architect Maureen Soh highlighted the Western symmetry in its layout. Eastern elements are present in the Malay eaves. Carved Chinese \"breeze blocks\" with cut-out designs set into the wrap-around verandas let in lots of fresh air. The 2m-wide verandas shade people from the brutal tropical sun. Said Ms Soh, who first saw Sri Temasek in 2004: \"It was rundown. But I felt more for the building as I worked on it. \"It is a simple building but has special features such as tiers of arches and columns,\" she added. Set serenely on a knoll, Sri Temasek overlooks lush gardens, and there are glimpses of the city skyline. In the 1998 book, The Man And His Ideas, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is reported saying that his three children were seven, five and two when he became PM in 1959. He and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek. He said: \"We did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs.\" The family stayed there only briefly in 1965 - for security reasons, amid the turmoil of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Mr Lee Hsien Loong too decided not to make Sri Temasek his home when he became PM in 2004. Still, the family would have fond memories of the grounds. The three children ran around in the evening, \"while Kuan Yew played golf or practised on the practice tee and the putting green\", Madam Kwa said in a Straits Times interview in 2000. These unspoken historical and personal reasons may have prompted the choice of Sri Temasek as the setting for this year's National Day message.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This story was first published on April 5, 2010 The greatest distance to cover in any race is the distance between your ears. Strength does not come from physical capability, but from an indomitable will. So says Yong Yuen Cheng, fastest finisher of the 218-km Run Round Singapore in 31hr 28min 51sec. Of course, many people think he has lost whatever was between his ears, judging by the distance - equivalent to more than five marathons - he covered on March 28 to mark Nanyang Technological University's 55th anniversary. Why would anyone want to put themselves through an experience littered with low points like cramps, diarrhoea, dislodged toenails, blisters, heat, sleepiness and excruciating leg pain - and end up in a wheelchair after? Crazy! Yong, 38, agrees. \"If one is not well-trained, conditioned, prepared, experienced or supported,\" says the ultra-runner, who is in the business of logic (he is a Hwa Chong Institution physics teacher), \"then yes, running 218km is crazy.\" But he will tell you that he built up his mileage gradually since last May, down to the nitty-gritties of date, distance and time (his reply took a full page). Races and other organised mass running events doubled up as long training runs - a good way of \"setting short-term goals in terms of preparation\", he says. Twice - in the span of two weeks at the end of last year - he ran five marathons in five days to condition his body to the 218km distance. He will tell you that he is neither a fast nor talented runner. In his Secondary 1 fitness test, he took more than 16min to run 2.4km. In his first road race as a 17-year-old student at National Junior College, the school canoeist came in 148th. He trained his heart out the next year, but managed only 24th. His first marathon in 1992 is his fastest to date (3hr 52min). It was only at the 2004 MR25 Ultramarathon, where he ran 84km in 10hr 36min and was fifth, that he realised he was \"not bad\" at ultras. To those who still don't understand why Yong does what he does, he will tell you he was a sickly child. In Primary 2, he weighed just 19kg, in P6, just 26kg (the average boy would be 40kg by then). Running for him is a blessing. \"Actually, I expected little from the run in terms of placing because I know how much slower I am compared with most of the other runners,\" says Yong, who rested just one day before going back to work last Tuesday. \"But I feel lucky that this has become a good lesson for my students.\" And, that is, that anyone can achieve the extraordinary.

       "      <td>Twelve-year-old Jordan Foo received a belated birthday gift on Wednesday: a coveted place in the finals of a nationwide search for Singapore's best speller. The Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) pupil will slug it out with 28 others from other schools at the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship finals next Saturday. The group of finalists - the largest number to date - represent the top spellers here and were whittled down from a pool of 1,200 contestants who took part in the preliminary rounds. Jordan, who turned 12 on Tuesday, had tripped on \"eking\" in round seven, but he said he kept his hopes up despite not winning in the zone. Only the four zonal winners were guaranteed a place, while the others were ranked nationally by the Ministry of Education (MOE).Natasha Lee, 10, thought she would not stand a chance as she was axed in round six, tripping on the word \"sacrosanct\". So when her mum, teacher Cecilia Ow, 42, broke the news that she was in the finals, the first thing the Primary 5 pupil from Xinghua Primary School uttered was: \"No... Really?\" \"I didn't believe my mum. It was so shocking. I didn't think I would get in,\" she said. Though she has a Scrabble competition on the same day, Natasha said she is picking the spelling competition because \"my heart says spelling\". \"I want to do the spelling because I put in a lot of hard work,\" she said. Besides working on her words, she will try to avoid falling ill ahead of next week's championship. At the finals, pupils will have to spell their given words orally in front of a 500-strong audience. Utter one wrong letter and they will be out. However, they may get help by asking questions such as what the word's language of origin is or what the definition is - all within a 60-second time limit. Madam Halimah Yacob, the Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports, will be the guest of honour at the event, to be held at the Raffles City Convention Centre. Bragging rights aside, Singapore's champion speller will win $5,000 and a trophy, while his or her school will take the challenge trophy. This is the first year RHB Banking Group and The Straits Times have teamed up to organise the event, which is held in partnership with MOE. serl@sph.com.sg</td>\n",

       "      <td>Why celebrate a spelling champ in the digital age</td>\n",
       "      <td>Competitive spelling is a mind sport. Like watching any sportsman demonstrate excellence by besting another, it offers a glimpse of human drama at its most sublime. I sat on a judging panel last weekend, gripped by Singapore's top young spellers during the zonal rounds of the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship. I cheered inwardly when a child got a word right, his face lighting up with the satisfaction of a runner having cleared his heats. Far harder was watching the crushing blow of a misspelled word and the ensuing tears. But I am convinced: To say that we do not need to spell well in a digital age of countless technological checks is to say we don't need the Olympics because there are Xbox simulations of sports. Expert spellers demonstrate technical ability worthy of a national platform. The skill of holding a lengthy, often illogical string of letters in your head, then articulating them in their correct sequence, is a feat that calls for memory, study, strategy, intelligence and, most importantly, nerves of steel. In a strong speller you will see not only an understanding of the definition of a word, but also its precise application. Such an expert is likely to be able to express that he is not merely happy, but describe exactly the degree of his elation, exuberance and felicity. This may be why witnessing a young mind trying to discern how many 'Ls' there are in \"dilettante\", if \"eking\" contains another \"e\", or if \"odyssey\" needs an \"i\" or \"y\", is so addictive. You get to see how widely the speller has read, his command of semantics, and how deeply he loves the language. No English language learner can be an exponent without mastery of spelling, in the same way no one can be a tennis champ without the ability to serve. What a competition like The Big Spell does is deepen the appreciation of what a young English expert is capable of under pressure, without any help from the Internet. To give the curious a sense of just how tough spelling can be, I quizzed several adults on selected words from the 50 featured in the competition's preliminary round. Can you spell \"berserk\", I asked. How about \"menagerie\"? Now, \"diphtheria\". Not one of the 20 people I asked got all three correct. Some said flatly: \"No, I cannot. I use Google.\" Others said: \"I can do it if I can write it down on paper.\" Or: \"Who says diphtheria has an extra 'h'?\" And: \"You didn't even pronounce the word correctly!\" Then the sheepish admission: \"Actually, this is quite hard.\" Unlike the child competitors of The Big Spell, my peers and I, I fear, have been neglecting our fundamentals. Having drunk from the fountain of autocorrect, we have become spoiled, slack, uninterested - and worse, unabashed about it. Educators rightly fret about the impact of the digital age on language skills. Pervasive technology is creating a paradox that they daily battle: At no point in history have young people done more writing by composing texts, exchanging e-mail and instant messages, and posting on social networks. Yet few regard their informal communication as \"real\" writing, so they employ the lowest grades of language. Truncations, lax punctuation, acronyms, IM speak, slang and bad grammar are everywhere. So reliant are we now on software that delivers us from errors and even feeds us synonyms, that our confidence in our own language skills is eroding. Unlike champion spellers, adults no longer take pride in getting a word spelt right, or feel shame at getting it wrong. We expect some magical digital check to clean up the mess. Unfortunately, without a healthy respect for the foundational elements of a language, experts believe, we can never develop a deep understanding of its heritage and culture. How can we ever love it fully, they say, when we cannot claim to know it intimately? A platform that celebrates spelling in this era helps to keep standards from falling. It challenges English language learners to strive for expertise and be the best they can be. As for us adults, maybe it's time we started thinking of a grown-up version of the game. sereneg@sph.com.sg</td>\n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Former president Halimah Yacob has been conferred the nation’s highest civilian honour, the Order of Temasek (With High Distinction). She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Over three years’ jail for man who cheated 68 victims of $383k in one of S’pore’s worst rental scams</td>\n",
       "      <td>SINGAPORE – The man behind one of Singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on Wednesday. Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

SINGAPORE - A 19-year-old woman, Miss Felicia Teo Wei Ling, was last seen leaving for work 19 days ago. Described as 1.6m tall, slim, slightly tanned, and with short, black hair, she had left for work from her Block 233, Bain Street flat at 6pm on June 29. Lianhe Wanbao reported last week that Miss Teo had told her family that she would be attending a friend's wedding on June 30. However, she did not turn up at the wedding. Her brother, 18-year-old Teo Wei De, told Lianhe Wanbao that his sister was a final-year student at Lasalle College of the Arts. Since her disappearance, 100 friends and relatives have been searching her favourite hangouts, including Marine Parade, Clarke Quay and East Coast. Yesterday, police appealed for anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact them on 1800-255-0000.   \n",

Sri Temasek, a just-restored colonial bungalow in the Istana domain, has piqued curiosity since Mr Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message there last Friday. Built in 1869 for the then-colony secretary, it remains today the official residence of the Singapore prime minister. But none of the three PMs - Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Goh Chok Tong or Mr Lee Hsien Loong - has made it his home. Instead, Sri Temasek stars silently at official functions and tells the story of Singapore's early diplomatic life. Foreign leaders near and far were hosted on its intimate premises, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them was \"the Father of Malaysia\", the late Tunku Abdul Rahman. The late Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi dropped in too, as did Jordan's King Hussein and US Vice-President Spiro Agnew in the Nixon days. Lord Denis Healey, the defence secretary who announced the 1968 British troop withdrawal from Singapore, was pictured there wielding chopsticks at a small dinner while then-PM Lee Kuan Yew looked on, bemused. In 1962, Mr Lee hosted a party to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore's merger with Malaysia. In 1983, the body of the late finance minister Hon Sui Sen lay in state for a couple of days at the stately two-storey building for people to pay their last respects. The bungalow was built by Major J. F. A. McNair, a civil engineer who also had a hand in the soaring Gothic design of St Andrew's Cathedral. Designed in an East-West style, the red-roofed Sri Temasek is 1,600 sq m, and distinguished by arches. For some years, the national monument fell into disrepair and was not used. It was mostly restored this March, and will be used for small state functions. The Straits Times viewed Sri Temasek yesterday with architects from CPG Consultants, the firm restoring it. Senior architect Maureen Soh highlighted the Western symmetry in its layout. Eastern elements are present in the Malay eaves. Carved Chinese \"breeze blocks\" with cut-out designs set into the wrap-around verandas let in lots of fresh air. The 2m-wide verandas shade people from the brutal tropical sun. Said Ms Soh, who first saw Sri Temasek in 2004: \"It was rundown. But I felt more for the building as I worked on it. \"It is a simple building but has special features such as tiers of arches and columns,\" she added. Set serenely on a knoll, Sri Temasek overlooks lush gardens, and there are glimpses of the city skyline. In the 1998 book, The Man And His Ideas, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is reported saying that his three children were seven, five and two when he became PM in 1959. He and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek. He said: \"We did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs.\" The family stayed there only briefly in 1965 - for security reasons, amid the turmoil of Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Mr Lee Hsien Loong too decided not to make Sri Temasek his home when he became PM in 2004. Still, the family would have fond memories of the grounds. The three children ran around in the evening, \"while Kuan Yew played golf or practised on the practice tee and the putting green\", Madam Kwa said in a Straits Times interview in 2000. These unspoken historical and personal reasons may have prompted the choice of Sri Temasek as the setting for this year's National Day message.   \n",

Strength does not come from physical capability, but from an indomitable will. So says Yong Yuen Cheng, fastest finisher of the 218-km Run Round Singapore in 31hr 28min 51sec. Of course, many people think he has lost whatever was between his ears, judging by the distance - equivalent to more than five marathons - he covered on March 28 to mark Nanyang Technological University's 55th anniversary. Why would anyone want to put themselves through an experience littered with low points like cramps, diarrhoea, dislodged toenails, blisters, heat, sleepiness and excruciating leg pain - and end up in a wheelchair after? Crazy! Yong, 38, agrees. \"If one is not well-trained, conditioned, prepared, experienced or supported,\" says the ultra-runner, who is in the business of logic (he is a Hwa Chong Institution physics teacher), \"then yes, running 218km is crazy.\" But he will tell you that he built up his mileage gradually since last May, down to the nitty-gritties of date, distance and time (his reply took a full page). Races and other organised mass running events doubled up as long training runs - a good way of \"setting short-term goals in terms of preparation\", he says. Twice - in the span of two weeks at the end of last year - he ran five marathons in five days to condition his body to the 218km distance. He will tell you that he is neither a fast nor talented runner. In his Secondary 1 fitness test, he took more than 16min to run 2.4km. In his first road race as a 17-year-old student at National Junior College, the school canoeist came in 148th. He trained his heart out the next year, but managed only 24th. His first marathon in 1992 is his fastest to date (3hr 52min). It was only at the 2004 MR25 Ultramarathon, where he ran 84km in 10hr 36min and was fifth, that he realised he was \"not bad\" at ultras. To those who still don't understand why Yong does what he does, he will tell you he was a sickly child. In Primary 2, he weighed just 19kg, in P6, just 26kg (the average boy would be 40kg by then). Running for him is a blessing. \"Actually, I expected little from the run in terms of placing because I know how much slower I am compared with most of the other runners,\" says Yong, who rested just one day before going back to work last Tuesday. \"But I feel lucky that this has become a good lesson for my students.\" And, that is, that anyone can achieve the extraordinary.

The Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) pupil will slug it out with 28 others from other schools at the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship finals next Saturday. The group of finalists - the largest number to date - represent the top spellers here and were whittled down from a pool of 1,200 contestants who took part in the preliminary rounds. Jordan, who turned 12 on Tuesday, had tripped on \"eking\" in round seven, but he said he kept his hopes up despite not winning in the zone. Only the four zonal winners were guaranteed a place, while the others were ranked nationally by the Ministry of Education (MOE).Natasha Lee, 10, thought she would not stand a chance as she was axed in round six, tripping on the word \"sacrosanct\". So when her mum, teacher Cecilia Ow, 42, broke the news that she was in the finals, the first thing the Primary 5 pupil from Xinghua Primary School uttered was: \"No... Really?\" \"I didn't believe my mum. It was so shocking. I didn't think I would get in,\" she said. Though she has a Scrabble competition on the same day, Natasha said she is picking the spelling competition because \"my heart says spelling\". \"I want to do the spelling because I put in a lot of hard work,\" she said. Besides working on her words, she will try to avoid falling ill ahead of next week's championship. At the finals, pupils will have to spell their given words orally in front of a 500-strong audience. Utter one wrong letter and they will be out. However, they may get help by asking questions such as what the word's language of origin is or what the definition is - all within a 60-second time limit. Madam Halimah Yacob, the Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports, will be the guest of honour at the event, to be held at the Raffles City Convention Centre. Bragging rights aside, Singapore's champion speller will win $5,000 and a trophy, while his or her school will take the challenge trophy. This is the first year RHB Banking Group and The Straits Times have teamed up to organise the event, which is held in partnership with MOE. serl@sph.com.sg   \n",

Like watching any sportsman demonstrate excellence by besting another, it offers a glimpse of human drama at its most sublime. I sat on a judging panel last weekend, gripped by Singapore's top young spellers during the zonal rounds of the RHB-The Straits Times National Spelling Championship. I cheered inwardly when a child got a word right, his face lighting up with the satisfaction of a runner having cleared his heats. Far harder was watching the crushing blow of a misspelled word and the ensuing tears. But I am convinced: To say that we do not need to spell well in a digital age of countless technological checks is to say we don't need the Olympics because there are Xbox simulations of sports. Expert spellers demonstrate technical ability worthy of a national platform. The skill of holding a lengthy, often illogical string of letters in your head, then articulating them in their correct sequence, is a feat that calls for memory, study, strategy, intelligence and, most importantly, nerves of steel. In a strong speller you will see not only an understanding of the definition of a word, but also its precise application. Such an expert is likely to be able to express that he is not merely happy, but describe exactly the degree of his elation, exuberance and felicity. This may be why witnessing a young mind trying to discern how many 'Ls' there are in \"dilettante\", if \"eking\" contains another \"e\", or if \"odyssey\" needs an \"i\" or \"y\", is so addictive. You get to see how widely the speller has read, his command of semantics, and how deeply he loves the language. No English language learner can be an exponent without mastery of spelling, in the same way no one can be a tennis champ without the ability to serve. What a competition like The Big Spell does is deepen the appreciation of what a young English expert is capable of under pressure, without any help from the Internet. To give the curious a sense of just how tough spelling can be, I quizzed several adults on selected words from the 50 featured in the competition's preliminary round. Can you spell \"berserk\", I asked. How about \"menagerie\"? Now, \"diphtheria\". Not one of the 20 people I asked got all three correct. Some said flatly: \"No, I cannot. I use Google.\" Others said: \"I can do it if I can write it down on paper.\" Or: \"Who says diphtheria has an extra 'h'?\" And: \"You didn't even pronounce the word correctly!\" Then the sheepish admission: \"Actually, this is quite hard.\" Unlike the child competitors of The Big Spell, my peers and I, I fear, have been neglecting our fundamentals. Having drunk from the fountain of autocorrect, we have become spoiled, slack, uninterested - and worse, unabashed about it. Educators rightly fret about the impact of the digital age on language skills. Pervasive technology is creating a paradox that they daily battle: At no point in history have young people done more writing by composing texts, exchanging e-mail and instant messages, and posting on social networks. Yet few regard their informal communication as \"real\" writing, so they employ the lowest grades of language. Truncations, lax punctuation, acronyms, IM speak, slang and bad grammar are everywhere. So reliant are we now on software that delivers us from errors and even feeds us synonyms, that our confidence in our own language skills is eroding. Unlike champion spellers, adults no longer take pride in getting a word spelt right, or feel shame at getting it wrong. We expect some magical digital check to clean up the mess. Unfortunately, without a healthy respect for the foundational elements of a language, experts believe, we can never develop a deep understanding of its heritage and culture. How can we ever love it fully, they say, when we cannot claim to know it intimately? A platform that celebrates spelling in this era helps to keep standards from falling. It challenges English language learners to strive for expertise and be the best they can be. As for us adults, maybe it's time we started thinking of a grown-up version of the game. sereneg@sph.com.sg   \n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).   \n",

Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "29713  SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – An elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Former president Halimah Yacob has been conferred the nation’s highest civilian honour, the Order of Temasek (With High Distinction). She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – The man behind one of Singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on Wednesday. Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

On Monday morning, in groups of four, 20 beneficiaries of the Straits Times Pocket Money Fund (SPMF) participated in a race that saw them hit stations at iconic landmarks around the airport, including the Butterfly Garden at Terminal 3's transit lounge and the Kinetic Rain art display in Terminal 1's public area. After the race ended, the children witnessed Changi Airport Group's (CAG) $360,000 donation to SPMF. The donation, to be disbursed over five years, will provide 50 post-secondary students with pocket money for as many years. The donation will be part of the fund's pilot extension in 2013 beyond primary and secondary school to beneficiaries studying in the Institute of Technical Education, junior colleges and polytechnics.   \n",

The celebrations, which included a family carnival and a band competition, culminated in a fireworks display at midnight, followed by a performance from winning band Emerald Street. Also performing was Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong, who played the electric guitar with youth band Fancy This Progression in the opening act, for the song Wake Me Up When December Ends. Lyrics were modified from the song Wake Me Up When September Ends by American band Green Day. Many came to the Boon Lay party with umbrellas due to the drizzle earlier at night, while some walked barefoot in the field, which had been made muddy by the heavy rain in the afternoon. The Boon Lay countdown party, now into its 10th year, was one of the biggest celebrations among the more than 50 in the heartland and featured only local acts.   \n",

The display, which lasted a total of eight minutes, lit up the night sky as strains of music by Cultural Medallion winner Iskandar Ismail filled the air. The fireworks, which illuminated the sky, also provided a backdrop for the hundreds of white spheres bobbing in the bay, each containing different wishes for 2013 penned by revellers. Watched by tens of thousands of attendees at the Marina Bay countdown party, the atmosphere was electric as the crowd counted down the seconds in unison. The drizzle earlier in the day and the crowd did little to deter the revellers. Mr Lance Chan, 29, a logistics officer in the shipping industry described the experience as \"cool and fun\". This was his fifth countdown party. Mr Chan, who was at the party with his wife, said: \"We are here to catch the fireworks and just get out of the house and live life.\"   \n",

The boy, believed to be from India but attending school here, said in a Facebook post that the day he leaves Singapore, he is going to take \"a big big revenge\" and \"spit everywhere\" and \"plant bombs on Marina Bay Sands\".

Liaw Kim Chew, 51, is alleged to have given between $5,000 and $30,000 to Mr Peter Khoo Chong Meng, a former senior vice-president SPH's English and Malay Newspapers Division and head of its Editorial Projects Unit, to ensure that he would be awarded business deals from the unit between 2006 and 2010. In the charge involving the $30,000 bribe, Liaw is said to have ensured that he would clinch a deal to supply 100,000 coin banks to the Editorial Project Unit. Mr Khoo was fined $100,000 last month after he had pleaded guilty to two charges of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. The 49-year-old was also ordered to pay a penalty of $83,500. Liaw, who is represented by Mr Prabhakaran Nair, will appear in court again on Jan 30. If convicted, he could be fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years on each charge.   \n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).   \n",

Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "29677  SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – An elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Former president Halimah Yacob has been conferred the nation’s highest civilian honour, the Order of Temasek (With High Distinction). She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Over three years’ jail for man who cheated 68 victims of $383k in one of S’pore’s worst rental scams</td>\n",
       "      <td>SINGAPORE – The man behind one of Singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on Wednesday. Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

On Monday morning, in groups of four, 20 beneficiaries of the Straits Times Pocket Money Fund (SPMF) participated in a race that saw them hit stations at iconic landmarks around the airport, including the Butterfly Garden at Terminal 3's transit lounge and the Kinetic Rain art display in Terminal 1's public area. After the race ended, the children witnessed Changi Airport Group's (CAG) $360,000 donation to SPMF. The donation, to be disbursed over five years, will provide 50 post-secondary students with pocket money for as many years. The donation will be part of the fund's pilot extension in 2013 beyond primary and secondary school to beneficiaries studying in the Institute of Technical Education, junior colleges and polytechnics.   \n",

The celebrations, which included a family carnival and a band competition, culminated in a fireworks display at midnight, followed by a performance from winning band Emerald Street. Also performing was Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong, who played the electric guitar with youth band Fancy This Progression in the opening act, for the song Wake Me Up When December Ends. Lyrics were modified from the song Wake Me Up When September Ends by American band Green Day. Many came to the Boon Lay party with umbrellas due to the drizzle earlier at night, while some walked barefoot in the field, which had been made muddy by the heavy rain in the afternoon. The Boon Lay countdown party, now into its 10th year, was one of the biggest celebrations among the more than 50 in the heartland and featured only local acts.   \n",

The display, which lasted a total of eight minutes, lit up the night sky as strains of music by Cultural Medallion winner Iskandar Ismail filled the air. The fireworks, which illuminated the sky, also provided a backdrop for the hundreds of white spheres bobbing in the bay, each containing different wishes for 2013 penned by revellers. Watched by tens of thousands of attendees at the Marina Bay countdown party, the atmosphere was electric as the crowd counted down the seconds in unison. The drizzle earlier in the day and the crowd did little to deter the revellers. Mr Lance Chan, 29, a logistics officer in the shipping industry described the experience as \"cool and fun\". This was his fifth countdown party. Mr Chan, who was at the party with his wife, said: \"We are here to catch the fireworks and just get out of the house and live life.\"   \n",

The boy, believed to be from India but attending school here, said in a Facebook post that the day he leaves Singapore, he is going to take \"a big big revenge\" and \"spit everywhere\" and \"plant bombs on Marina Bay Sands\".

Liaw Kim Chew, 51, is alleged to have given between $5,000 and $30,000 to Mr Peter Khoo Chong Meng, a former senior vice-president SPH's English and Malay Newspapers Division and head of its Editorial Projects Unit, to ensure that he would be awarded business deals from the unit between 2006 and 2010. In the charge involving the $30,000 bribe, Liaw is said to have ensured that he would clinch a deal to supply 100,000 coin banks to the Editorial Project Unit. Mr Khoo was fined $100,000 last month after he had pleaded guilty to two charges of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. The 49-year-old was also ordered to pay a penalty of $83,500. Liaw, who is represented by Mr Prabhakaran Nair, will appear in court again on Jan 30. If convicted, he could be fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years on each charge.   \n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).   \n",

Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "29677  SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

    "(3) By HDB towns - Most meaningful category. However, it means that non-HDB towns (e.g. Orchard with a lot of private housing) will be outside the scope of this analysis. Also, a lot of sub-towns (e.g. Chong Pang, Khatib, Boon Lay) are missed out (see: https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home)\n",

    "(4) URA Planning Areas - Very detailed, comes in both 'Planning Areas' and 'Subzone'. However, this is used for government planning and administrative purposes, and does not translate to much meaning on the ground.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – An elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13.

She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – The man behind one of Singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on Wednesday. Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>singapore – four luxury cars linked to singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (gcb) in third avenue, off bukit timah road, on wednesday. at around 2.30pm, a red rolls-royce dawn, a black rolls-royce cullinan, a red porsche 911 targa and a white toyota alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. the cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in september by a commercial affairs department (cad) officer. the gcb was rented by vanuatu national su jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. the straits times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. at least eight police officers were at the property. the first to be towed out was the cullinan, followed by the dawn, the alphard, and then the targa. each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. st followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near pioneer road, where all four cars were parked. there were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue rolls-royce. on wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. four cars and 56 bearbrick ornaments were seized. the police did not say where the other location was. a bearbrick – stylised as be@rbrick – is a collectible toy figure produced by japanese collectible company medicom toy. the toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. mr shawn wee, the owner of collectibles store eye for toys, had told st in august that the bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. the police said: “as part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” the cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. this means they cannot be sold. the vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. the case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. the police had said in august that su was arrested at his residence in third avenue. he faces four money laundering charges. on oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. in fact, investigations show that this firm, an xing technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. the cad officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. they include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

On Monday morning, in groups of four, 20 beneficiaries of the Straits Times Pocket Money Fund (SPMF) participated in a race that saw them hit stations at iconic landmarks around the airport, including the Butterfly Garden at Terminal 3's transit lounge and the Kinetic Rain art display in Terminal 1's public area. After the race ended, the children witnessed Changi Airport Group's (CAG) $360,000 donation to SPMF. The donation, to be disbursed over five years, will provide 50 post-secondary students with pocket money for as many years. The donation will be part of the fund's pilot extension in 2013 beyond primary and secondary school to beneficiaries studying in the Institute of Technical Education, junior colleges and polytechnics.   \n",

The celebrations, which included a family carnival and a band competition, culminated in a fireworks display at midnight, followed by a performance from winning band Emerald Street. Also performing was Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong, who played the electric guitar with youth band Fancy This Progression in the opening act, for the song Wake Me Up When December Ends. Lyrics were modified from the song Wake Me Up When September Ends by American band Green Day. Many came to the Boon Lay party with umbrellas due to the drizzle earlier at night, while some walked barefoot in the field, which had been made muddy by the heavy rain in the afternoon. The Boon Lay countdown party, now into its 10th year, was one of the biggest celebrations among the more than 50 in the heartland and featured only local acts.   \n",

The display, which lasted a total of eight minutes, lit up the night sky as strains of music by Cultural Medallion winner Iskandar Ismail filled the air. The fireworks, which illuminated the sky, also provided a backdrop for the hundreds of white spheres bobbing in the bay, each containing different wishes for 2013 penned by revellers. Watched by tens of thousands of attendees at the Marina Bay countdown party, the atmosphere was electric as the crowd counted down the seconds in unison. The drizzle earlier in the day and the crowd did little to deter the revellers. Mr Lance Chan, 29, a logistics officer in the shipping industry described the experience as \"cool and fun\". This was his fifth countdown party. Mr Chan, who was at the party with his wife, said: \"We are here to catch the fireworks and just get out of the house and live life.\"   \n",

The boy, believed to be from India but attending school here, said in a Facebook post that the day he leaves Singapore, he is going to take \"a big big revenge\" and \"spit everywhere\" and \"plant bombs on Marina Bay Sands\".

Liaw Kim Chew, 51, is alleged to have given between $5,000 and $30,000 to Mr Peter Khoo Chong Meng, a former senior vice-president SPH's English and Malay Newspapers Division and head of its Editorial Projects Unit, to ensure that he would be awarded business deals from the unit between 2006 and 2010. In the charge involving the $30,000 bribe, Liaw is said to have ensured that he would clinch a deal to supply 100,000 coin banks to the Editorial Project Unit. Mr Khoo was fined $100,000 last month after he had pleaded guilty to two charges of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. The 49-year-old was also ordered to pay a penalty of $83,500. Liaw, who is represented by Mr Prabhakaran Nair, will appear in court again on Jan 30. If convicted, he could be fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years on each charge.   \n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).   \n",

Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "29677  SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

airplanes took off on the tarmac outside. on monday morning, in groups of four, 20 beneficiaries of the straits times pocket money fund (spmf) participated in a race that saw them hit stations at iconic landmarks around the airport, including the butterfly garden at terminal 3's transit lounge and the kinetic rain art display in terminal 1's public area. after the race ended, the children witnessed changi airport group's (cag) $360,000 donation to spmf. the donation, to be disbursed over five years, will provide 50 post-secondary students with pocket money for as many years. the donation will be part of the fund's pilot extension in 2013 beyond primary and secondary school to beneficiaries studying in the institute of technical education, junior colleges and polytechnics.

as strains of music by cultural medallion winner iskandar ismail filled the air. the fireworks, which illuminated the sky, also provided a backdrop for the hundreds of white spheres bobbing in the bay, each containing different wishes for 2013 penned by revellers. watched by tens of thousands of attendees at the marina bay countdown party, the atmosphere was electric as the crowd counted down



                                                                                                                                 singapore – an elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. on wednesday, chia gek yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (mto) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. before handing down the sentence, district judge carol ling said chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. but the judge stressed that the tragedy of ms koimatun achmad ali’s death was not lost on the court. should chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the mto and sentence him again, said judge ling. chia pleaded guilty earlier in august to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. he came to court in a wheelchair on wednesday to receive his sentence. the court heard previously that on jan 29, 2022, chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of block 39 telok blangah rise. he was on his bed in the living room. thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. he then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. when the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. after that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. they were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. police and singapore civil defence force (scdf) officers arrived at the scene soon after. as the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. the fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which scdf officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. they made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious ms koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. she had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. as chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. he was arrested shortly after. defence lawyer riko isaac said in a written mitigation plea that chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. at the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. a psychiatrist at the institute of mental health (imh) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. after chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. since then, chia has been attending regular follow-ups at imh, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said mr isaac. in sentencing, judge ling also noted that chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort. helplines mental well-being institute of mental health’s mental health helpline: 6389-2222 (24

halimah yacob has been conferred the nation’s highest civilian honour, the order of temasek (with high distinction). she will receive the award from president tharman shanmugaratnam on sunday at the national awards investiture to be held at the institute of technical education college central. madam halimah, 69, will head the list of national award recipients for 2023, said the prime minister’s office on wednesday. madam halimah, who was singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on sept 13. she did not seek re-election at the presidential election 2023, which was won by former senior minister tharman. madam halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. she told the straits times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “if my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, i am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” madam halimah said. since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the singapore university of social sciences. during her term as singapore’s eighth president, madam halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  she has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. under her watch, the president’s challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. the last person to be given this award was former senior minister

(this was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. in sentencing, district judge prem raj called zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. the judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. already unfamiliar with singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. for each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. the police said in march 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.  \n",
       "29677  singapore – four luxury cars linked to singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (gcb) in third avenue, off bukit timah road, on wednesday. at around 2.30pm, a red rolls-royce dawn, a black rolls-royce cullinan, a red porsche 911 targa and a white toyota alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. the cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in september by a commercial affairs department (cad) officer. the gcb was rented by vanuatu national su jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. the straits times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. at least eight police officers were at the property. the first to be towed out was the cullinan, followed by the dawn, the alphard, and then the targa. each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. st followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near pioneer road, where all four cars were parked. there were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue rolls-royce. on wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. four cars and 56 bearbrick ornaments were seized. the police did not say where the other location was. a bearbrick – stylised as be@rbrick – is a collectible toy figure produced by japanese collectible company medicom toy. the toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. mr shawn wee, the owner of collectibles store eye for toys, had told st in august that the bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. the police said: “as part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” the cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. this means they cannot be sold. the vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. the case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. the police had said in august that su was arrested at his residence in third avenue. he faces four money laundering charges. on oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. in fact, investigations show that this firm, an xing technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. the cad officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. they include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. according to an accounting and corporate regulatory authority search, su has another registered address at a st thomas walk condominium. he is wanted in china for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. another of the accused, cypriot national wang dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. this is the second time this week that st has seen items being moved out from gcbs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. on monday at around 2pm, st saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a gcb in nassim road. the pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. su baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the gcb in nassim road with his wife ma ning. there were several cars parked on the street during the operation. st also saw plain-clothes police officers there. last wednesday, st saw items being removed from another gcb in bishopsgate, off tanglin road, by movers. the house is rented by another accused – vang shuiming, or wang shuiming – and his wife wang ruiyan. vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. the items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of macallan 25 years sherry oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. the truck, which was escorted by the same car present in nassim road on monday, then travelled to le freeport singapore, a high-security storage facility in changi north crescent. it is touted as the safest area in singapore for wealth protection. shin min daily news had reported last friday that a number of other assets, including a rolls-royce and a bentley, were also transported from the bishopsgate house. plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. an anti-money laundering operation on aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as tanglin, bukit timah, orchard road, sentosa and river valley. ten foreigners, all originally from china, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.  \n",

                                                                                                                                           singapore – seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. last friday, state coroner adam nakhoda ruled that mr yap ee guan’s death on july 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the workplace safety and health council following the accident. these included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. according to the coroner’s report, mr yap was working for takenaka corp. since july 1, 2022, he had been deployed to a worksite in pasir ris industrial drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. takenaka had contracted bbr piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. on july 6, 2022, mr yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. as part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. after the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “i found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said state coroner nakhoda. the fragment hit mr yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. the 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. he was taken by ambulance to changi general hospital, where he underwent surgery. he suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. his family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. a decision was made to take him off life support. mr yap died on july 13, 2022. the coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. but he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. the coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in bbr’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  however, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. the coroner said he accepted the ministry of manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. the coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. he said: “shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. if such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “a pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”  \n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – An elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – The man behind one of Singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on Wednesday. Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>singapore – the man behind one of singapore’s largest rental scams, who continued to scam people while out on bail, was sentenced to three years and seven months’ jail on wednesday. gibson zeng xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including singapore, of over $380,000 in total. zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. deputy public prosecutor wong shiau yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, zeng was a sales executive at singapore housing company, which specialises in rentals. his job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. after leaving his job, zeng uploaded some of these photos on the airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. he added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said dpp wong. on jan 20, 2022, a group of three french nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in singapore that zeng had advertised on airbnb. they paid a deposit of $9,600 to zeng. however, on the agreed move-in date on feb 5, zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted covid-19. he offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. zeng was first arrested on feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. but he continued to scam more people. a singaporean man contacted zeng on may 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. but on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. the victim tried to contact zeng without success. he was arrested again on july 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. he was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. while out on bail, he cheated six more victims between aug 2 and 28 the same year. bail was revoked on oct 5, and he has been in remand since. dpp wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. the victims included people from south africa, the united states, portugal, israel and denmark. dpp wong said zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. she added: “the offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “the accused repeatedly put the victims off with covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (this was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. in sentencing, district judge prem raj called zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. the judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. already unfamiliar with singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. for each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. the police said in march 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

On Monday morning, in groups of four, 20 beneficiaries of the Straits Times Pocket Money Fund (SPMF) participated in a race that saw them hit stations at iconic landmarks around the airport, including the Butterfly Garden at Terminal 3's transit lounge and the Kinetic Rain art display in Terminal 1's public area. After the race ended, the children witnessed Changi Airport Group's (CAG) $360,000 donation to SPMF. The donation, to be disbursed over five years, will provide 50 post-secondary students with pocket money for as many years. The donation will be part of the fund's pilot extension in 2013 beyond primary and secondary school to beneficiaries studying in the Institute of Technical Education, junior colleges and polytechnics.   \n",

The celebrations, which included a family carnival and a band competition, culminated in a fireworks display at midnight, followed by a performance from winning band Emerald Street. Also performing was Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Lawrence Wong, who played the electric guitar with youth band Fancy This Progression in the opening act, for the song Wake Me Up When December Ends. Lyrics were modified from the song Wake Me Up When September Ends by American band Green Day. Many came to the Boon Lay party with umbrellas due to the drizzle earlier at night, while some walked barefoot in the field, which had been made muddy by the heavy rain in the afternoon. The Boon Lay countdown party, now into its 10th year, was one of the biggest celebrations among the more than 50 in the heartland and featured only local acts.   \n",

The display, which lasted a total of eight minutes, lit up the night sky as strains of music by Cultural Medallion winner Iskandar Ismail filled the air. The fireworks, which illuminated the sky, also provided a backdrop for the hundreds of white spheres bobbing in the bay, each containing different wishes for 2013 penned by revellers. Watched by tens of thousands of attendees at the Marina Bay countdown party, the atmosphere was electric as the crowd counted down the seconds in unison. The drizzle earlier in the day and the crowd did little to deter the revellers. Mr Lance Chan, 29, a logistics officer in the shipping industry described the experience as \"cool and fun\". This was his fifth countdown party. Mr Chan, who was at the party with his wife, said: \"We are here to catch the fireworks and just get out of the house and live life.\"   \n",

The boy, believed to be from India but attending school here, said in a Facebook post that the day he leaves Singapore, he is going to take \"a big big revenge\" and \"spit everywhere\" and \"plant bombs on Marina Bay Sands\".

Liaw Kim Chew, 51, is alleged to have given between $5,000 and $30,000 to Mr Peter Khoo Chong Meng, a former senior vice-president SPH's English and Malay Newspapers Division and head of its Editorial Projects Unit, to ensure that he would be awarded business deals from the unit between 2006 and 2010. In the charge involving the $30,000 bribe, Liaw is said to have ensured that he would clinch a deal to supply 100,000 coin banks to the Editorial Project Unit. Mr Khoo was fined $100,000 last month after he had pleaded guilty to two charges of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. The 49-year-old was also ordered to pay a penalty of $83,500. Liaw, who is represented by Mr Prabhakaran Nair, will appear in court again on Jan 30. If convicted, he could be fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years on each charge.   \n",

On Wednesday, Chia Gek Yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (MTO) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Carol Ling said Chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. Imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. But the judge stressed that the tragedy of Ms Koimatun Achmad Ali’s death was not lost on the court. Should Chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the MTO and sentence him again, said Judge Ling. Chia pleaded guilty earlier in August to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. He came to court in a wheelchair on Wednesday to receive his sentence. The court heard previously that on Jan 29, 2022, Chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise. He was on his bed in the living room. Thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. He then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. When the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. After that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. They were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers arrived at the scene soon after. As the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. The fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which SCDF officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. They made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious Ms Koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. She had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. As Chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. He was arrested shortly after. Defence lawyer Riko Isaac said in a written mitigation plea that Chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. After Chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. Since then, Chia has been attending regular follow-ups at IMH, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said Mr Isaac. In sentencing, Judge Ling also noted that Chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort.

She will receive the award from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Sunday at the National Awards Investiture to be held at the Institute of Technical Education College Central. Madam Halimah, 69, will head the list of National Award recipients for 2023, said the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. Madam Halimah, who was Singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on Sept 13. She did not seek re-election at the Presidential Election 2023, which was won by former senior minister Tharman. Madam Halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. She told The Straits Times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of Singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “If my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, I am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” Madam Halimah said. Since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. During her term as Singapore’s eighth president, Madam Halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  She has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. Under her watch, the President’s Challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. The last person to be given this award was former senior minister S. Jayakumar. Three former presidents of Singapore – Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Mr S R Nathan and Mr Wee Kim Wee – have also received the award, which was previously known as the Order of Temasek (First Class).   \n",

Gibson Zeng Xianfu, 29, swindled 68 victims from at least 12 countries, including Singapore, of over $380,000 in total. Zeng, who is currently remanded, had earlier pleaded guilty to 23 counts of cheating, with 39 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin told the court previously that between 2018 and 2020, Zeng was a sales executive at Singapore Housing Company, which specialises in rentals. His job was to take photos of rental units and arrange for viewings with clients. After leaving his job, Zeng uploaded some of these photos on the Airbnb platform despite not having the authority or ability to rent out those apartments. He added a veneer of legitimacy by preparing bogus tenancy agreements for his victims, said DPP Wong. On Jan 20, 2022, a group of three French nationals agreed to rent a unit for three months in Singapore that Zeng had advertised on Airbnb. They paid a deposit of $9,600 to Zeng. However, on the agreed move-in date on Feb 5, Zeng told them that the unit was unavailable as the previous tenant had contracted Covid-19. He offered another move-in date, but became uncontactable thereafter. Zeng was first arrested on Feb 10 and was released on bail the same day. But he continued to scam more people. A Singaporean man contacted Zeng on May 11 and paid $7,000 the next day to rent a unit and signed a tenancy agreement. But on the agreed move-in date, the man went there and discovered that it was occupied. Confused, he contacted the occupants’ agent and was told this was not the first time that people had shown up expecting to move in. The victim tried to contact Zeng without success. He was arrested again on July 20, 2022, and charged in court the next day. He was placed in remand for a week before being released on bail. While out on bail, he cheated six more victims between Aug 2 and 28 the same year. Bail was revoked on Oct 5, and he has been in remand since. DPP Wong said his victims included foreign students and locals who were waiting to move into their permanent homes. The victims included people from South Africa, the United States, Portugal, Israel and Denmark. DPP Wong said Zeng went to significant lengths to perpetrate the fraud and committed the offences out of pure greed, spending the money on himself. She added: “The offences were committed at a time when competition for rental units in the market was high due to limited supply and high demand. “The accused repeatedly put the victims off with Covid-19 as the dominant excuse. (This was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that Covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. Zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. In sentencing, District Judge Prem Raj called Zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. The judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. Already unfamiliar with Singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. For each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. The police said in March 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "29677  SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

airplanes took off on the tarmac outside. on monday morning, in groups of four, 20 beneficiaries of the straits times pocket money fund (spmf) participated in a race that saw them hit stations at iconic landmarks around the airport, including the butterfly garden at terminal 3's transit lounge and the kinetic rain art display in terminal 1's public area. after the race ended, the children witnessed changi airport group's (cag) $360,000 donation to spmf. the donation, to be disbursed over five years, will provide 50 post-secondary students with pocket money for as many years. the donation will be part of the fund's pilot extension in 2013 beyond primary and secondary school to beneficiaries studying in the institute of technical education, junior colleges and polytechnics.

as strains of music by cultural medallion winner iskandar ismail filled the air. the fireworks, which illuminated the sky, also provided a backdrop for the hundreds of white spheres bobbing in the bay, each containing different wishes for 2013 penned by revellers. watched by tens of thousands of attendees at the marina bay countdown party, the atmosphere was electric as the crowd counted down



                                                                                                                                 singapore – an elderly man suffering from bipolar disorder, who started a fire that caused a neighbour’s domestic helper to die of smoke inhalation, was ordered to undergo mandatory psychiatric treatment. on wednesday, chia gek yong, 73, was sentenced to a mandatory treatment order (mto) for two years in lieu of time behind bars. before handing down the sentence, district judge carol ling said chia’s mental condition had a contributory link to the offences. imposing a jail term on someone with a mental illness would not help to deter such offences, and rehabilitation may be the key sentencing consideration in such cases, she said. but the judge stressed that the tragedy of ms koimatun achmad ali’s death was not lost on the court. should chia fail to attend the treatments, the court may revoke the mto and sentence him again, said judge ling. chia pleaded guilty earlier in august to an offence of causing death by performing a rash act. he came to court in a wheelchair on wednesday to receive his sentence. the court heard previously that on jan 29, 2022, chia woke up around 4am in his flat on the 10th storey of block 39 telok blangah rise. he was on his bed in the living room. thinking he saw bed bugs, he sprayed his bed with cans of insecticide. he then used lighters to set the mattress on fire, believing the bed bugs were still alive. when the fire spread, he tried to put it out with several bottles of water but failed. after that, he exited the flat, leaving behind its four other occupants who were asleep. they were later jolted awake by the smoke and also left the unit. police and singapore civil defence force (scdf) officers arrived at the scene soon after. as the firefighting efforts continued, smoke from the blaze got thicker and infiltrated a flat on the 11th storey. the fire was brought under control shortly before 6am, after which scdf officers went to the 11th floor unit, only to find its front door locked. they made a forced entry into the unit and found an unconscious ms koimatun in a room next to the kitchen. she had breathing difficulties but was still alive when she was rushed to hospital, where she died around 10.30pm. as chia was escorted by the authorities to an assembly area, he admitted he had started the fire to “kill bed bugs”. he was arrested shortly after. defence lawyer riko isaac said in a written mitigation plea that chia had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 19 and experienced many instances of relapse since. at the time of the offence, he was experiencing a manic episode of moderate severity, said the lawyer. a psychiatrist at the institute of mental health (imh) noted that he had symptoms of grandiosity, reduced sleep and increased energy levels. after chia was remanded and started taking his medications again, medical staff noted improvements in his mood and behaviour. since then, chia has been attending regular follow-ups at imh, and his prognosis for managing his condition is positive, said mr isaac. in sentencing, judge ling also noted that chia had the support of his family members, and said his rehabilitation is a community-based effort. helplines mental well-being institute of mental health’s mental health helpline: 6389-2222 (24

halimah yacob has been conferred the nation’s highest civilian honour, the order of temasek (with high distinction). she will receive the award from president tharman shanmugaratnam on sunday at the national awards investiture to be held at the institute of technical education college central. madam halimah, 69, will head the list of national award recipients for 2023, said the prime minister’s office on wednesday. madam halimah, who was singapore’s first female president, served as head of state between 2017 and 2023, with her last day on sept 13. she did not seek re-election at the presidential election 2023, which was won by former senior minister tharman. madam halimah said she was deeply honoured to receive the award. she told the straits times in an e-mail that she was grateful to the people of singapore for the privilege of serving them all these years. “if my example of a female from a minority community who came from a very humble background but managed to overcome the odds can serve to encourage others, i am thankful for the opportunity to do so,” madam halimah said. since stepping down from the role of president, she has been appointed chancellor of the singapore university of social sciences. during her term as singapore’s eighth president, madam halimah was vocal about gender equality and spoke her mind on various social issues, such as the need to protect older workers.  she has also long been a strong proponent of building interfaith relationships and encouraging multicultural dialogue. under her watch, the president’s challenge had focused on empowering people with disabilities, building a digitally inclusive society and supporting caregivers, among other causes. the last person to be given this award was former senior minister

(this was) a move which was highly opportunistic and preyed on the fears of the victims given that covid-19 remains a transmissible disease,” said the prosecutor. zeng has since made restitution of about $29,800. in sentencing, district judge prem raj called zeng’s offences deliberate and premeditated, and said the sentence must reflect the need to strongly deter rental scams. the judge highlighted the plight of foreign students who fell victim to the con. already unfamiliar with singapore, they would have had the added hassle of trying to secure accommodation at the last minute after realising they were cheated, he said. for each charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing another person to deliver property, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. the police said in march 2023 that at least 305 people had fallen victim to rental scams in the first three months of the year, losing at least $1.7 million in total.   \n",
       "29677  singapore – four luxury cars linked to singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (gcb) in third avenue, off bukit timah road, on wednesday. at around 2.30pm, a red rolls-royce dawn, a black rolls-royce cullinan, a red porsche 911 targa and a white toyota alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. the cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in september by a commercial affairs department (cad) officer. the gcb was rented by vanuatu national su jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. the straits times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. at least eight police officers were at the property. the first to be towed out was the cullinan, followed by the dawn, the alphard, and then the targa. each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. st followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near pioneer road, where all four cars were parked. there were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue rolls-royce. on wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. four cars and 56 bearbrick ornaments were seized. the police did not say where the other location was. a bearbrick – stylised as be@rbrick – is a collectible toy figure produced by japanese collectible company medicom toy. the toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. mr shawn wee, the owner of collectibles store eye for toys, had told st in august that the bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. the police said: “as part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” the cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. this means they cannot be sold. the vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. the case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. the police had said in august that su was arrested at his residence in third avenue. he faces four money laundering charges. on oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. in fact, investigations show that this firm, an xing technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. the cad officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. they include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. according to an accounting and corporate regulatory authority search, su has another registered address at a st thomas walk condominium. he is wanted in china for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. another of the accused, cypriot national wang dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. this is the second time this week that st has seen items being moved out from gcbs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. on monday at around 2pm, st saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a gcb in nassim road. the pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. su baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the gcb in nassim road with his wife ma ning. there were several cars parked on the street during the operation. st also saw plain-clothes police officers there. last wednesday, st saw items being removed from another gcb in bishopsgate, off tanglin road, by movers. the house is rented by another accused – vang shuiming, or wang shuiming – and his wife wang ruiyan. vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. the items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of macallan 25 years sherry oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. the truck, which was escorted by the same car present in nassim road on monday, then travelled to le freeport singapore, a high-security storage facility in changi north crescent. it is touted as the safest area in singapore for wealth protection. shin min daily news had reported last friday that a number of other assets, including a rolls-royce and a bentley, were also transported from the bishopsgate house. plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. an anti-money laundering operation on aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as tanglin, bukit timah, orchard road, sentosa and river valley. ten foreigners, all originally from china, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

                                                                                                                                           singapore – seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. last friday, state coroner adam nakhoda ruled that mr yap ee guan’s death on july 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the workplace safety and health council following the accident. these included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. according to the coroner’s report, mr yap was working for takenaka corp. since july 1, 2022, he had been deployed to a worksite in pasir ris industrial drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. takenaka had contracted bbr piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. on july 6, 2022, mr yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. as part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. after the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “i found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said state coroner nakhoda. the fragment hit mr yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. the 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. he was taken by ambulance to changi general hospital, where he underwent surgery. he suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. his family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. a decision was made to take him off life support. mr yap died on july 13, 2022. the coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. but he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. the coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in bbr’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  however, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. the coroner said he accepted the ministry of manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. the coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. he said: “shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. if such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “a pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

The system employs two recent major changes to the NPCs' manpower, one of which is having Crime Strike Forces of plainclothes policemen to patrol crime hotspots daily, gather intelligence and track the whereabouts of persons of interest within the community. Policemen in T-shirts and shorts also form the Community Policing Unit on bikes and on foot, getting to know the neighbourhood's residents and helping to foster a more community-engaged policing culture. Clementi is part of the second phase of Cops roll-outs, and by the end of this month, five additional NPCs would also have adopted the system. They are Bishan, Punggol, Sengkang, Woodlands East and Woodlands West. Announcing the latest launch today was Minister (Prime Minister's Office) and Second Minister (Home Affairs and Trade &amp; Industry) S Iswaran, who said that all NPCs will be under this system by 2016.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - A recalcitrant offender whipped his son with a belt about 20 times in January, and then punched him in the abdomen in May despite a protection order prohibiting him from doing so. The 30-year-old father was sentenced to 10 months and three weeks’ jail after he pleaded guilty on Wednesday to offences including two counts of assault involving the seven-year-old boy. He cannot be named as there is a gag order to protect his son’s identity. The man was convicted of an unrelated assault charge in 2015 and sentenced to a month in jail. Four years later, he was convicted of a snatch theft and sentenced to a year behind bars. The current case happened on the afternoon of Jan 7, 2023. He flew into a rage in his Rivervale Crescent flat in Sengkang when he thought that his two sons – the victim and his younger brother – were not sleeping during their supposed nap time. His 27-year-old wife was at work at the time, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Melissa Heng. The father used a belt to repeatedly strike his older son on the right ear, shoulder, upper back and neck in one of the bedrooms at around 3pm that day. He stopped the beating when the child apologised. His wife came home about two hours later and saw red marks on their son’s body. After the boy told his mother about the assault, she made a police report. An ambulance later took him to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, where he was found with multiple bruises on his body, including his upper back. He was given medical leave from Jan 7 to 9. The mother then applied for an expedited order, which is a temporary personal protection order. It was granted by a district judge on Jan 10. The DPP said the order restrained the man from using violence against his wife, the victim and his younger son. The man was out on bail when he targeted the older son again on May 14. DPP Heng said: “The accused insisted that the victim had homework to complete. When the victim said that he did not have any, the accused said he was lying.” The accused then slapped the victim on his chest, face and arm, and punched him once in the abdomen, she added. The victim’s mother alerted the police at around 3.30pm. Officers arrested the man on May 14. He was released on bail two days later. He continued to reoffend on July 5 after the police attended to another call from his wife that day. Details about this call were not disclosed in court documents. When officers were talking to the offender outside his flat, a 26-year-old man came forward and asked to speak to him. The younger man’s name has been redacted from court documents. The officers allowed the two men to speak and they went to a nearby staircase landing. It turned out the offender had been involved in an earlier dispute with the other man’s father. When they started exchanging blows, the officers intervened and arrested the offender after stopping the fight. He was in a police vehicle heading towards Woodlands Division Regional Lockup when he hurled vulgarities at the officers, including asking a policeman if he wanted the offender’s leg to “fly” to his face.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - The Republic is making amendments to the Free Trade Zones Act to enhance regulation and control of goods that flow through the 10 free-trade zones (FTZs) in the country. The amendments include introducing a licensing regime on FTZ operators, new regulations on cargo handlers and more enforcement powers for Customs authorities, Senior Minister of State for Finance Chee Hong Tat said in Parliament on Wednesday. FTZs are designated areas where goods can be stored, handled and distributed without being subject to Customs duties or taxes. They play a vital role in strengthening Singapore’s position as the world’s largest transhipment hub. The Bill to amend the Act was tabled in Parliament on Sept 18. Mr Chee said the changes are necessary amid growing concerns that FTZs are being “misused for illicit activities such as weapons proliferation, environmental crimes and trade-based money laundering”. He added that perpetrators try to mask such illegal activities as legitimate trade. Examples include providing false or inaccurate information on a cargo shipment or by swopping legitimate goods with contraband before re-exporting. Singapore is the second busiest container port in the world and the largest transhipment hub, handling about a fifth of the world’s container transhipment traffic. Several MPs, including Associate Professor Jamus Lim of the Workers’ Party, Mr Shawn Huang (Jurong GRC), Mr Edward Chia (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) and Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang GRC), questioned the adequacy of the amendments. Mr Chee replied that criminals will always find new ways to circumvent the rules. To keep pace with evolving threats and the increasing sophistication of these criminals, Singapore has to “remain vigilant and strengthen its regulatory framework to detect and deter illicit trade”. As many FTZ operators are now private entities, Mr Chee said introducing a new licensing regime requiring them to go through an approval process is appropriate, as this will ensure that only those who meet the requirements are awarded licences. While cargo handlers and agents do not have to apply for licences, the proposed amendments seek to regulate and clearly lay out their responsibilities, which include monitoring and managing the movement of goods at their premises. They will also need to provide data on all goods passing through Singapore. Currently, only information on imported, exported or controlled goods is required. Mr Chee said this will enable better visibility of goods going through the Republic. “Customs can monitor the flows of goods for signs of illicit activity, and take the necessary action in close partnership with other international authorities.” The amendments proposed also seek to enhance the enforcement powers of Customs authorities. This includes allowing the Director-General of Customs to grant, renew, suspend or revoke licences, as well as impose or modify licensing conditions, order the removal of dangerous goods, and detain goods for inspection. Mr Chee addressed MPs’ concerns about the impact of the revised regulations on business costs, operational efficiency and Singapore’s overall competitiveness as a trading hub. He emphasised that Singapore wants to facilitate trade and maintain a business-friendly operating environment. However, it should not be misused by bad actors for their illegal activities. “The proposed amendments seek to strike the right balance between better governance and preserving our pro-business environment,” he said.  Mr Chee said the Government consulted industry stakeholders to make sure the changes are designed and implemented in a way that will minimise the costs and compliance burden for companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises.  Implementation of the provisions under the revised Act will be phased in from early 2024. Companies will also have a six-month period to adjust to the changes, Mr Chee added. “Today, we seek to formalise these amendments into law and, in doing so, put Singapore on a stronger footing to combat illicit trade and remain a critical node in global trade flows. This will help Singapore to safeguard our position as a global trade hub,” Mr Chee said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Societies that may be used for unlawful purposes, threaten Singapore’s safety and security, or whose activities are contrary to the Republic’s national interests, are not allowed to establish themselves here. But with the evolving geopolitical landscape, Singapore will need more levers to guard against such threats, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling. Parliament passed the Societies (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday, enacting changes to the Societies Act that will enable Singapore to better guard against such groups. The changes aim to strengthen the registration process and give more powers to the Registrar of Societies to ask questions and weed out suspicious applications. Previously, applications to register societies were processed by either the normal or the automatic route. Applications for societies related to religion, ethnicity, language and politics, which are known as specified societies, go through the normal route. This means a vetting and assessment process, which may involve several rounds of clarifications with applicants. All other societies are registered automatically when they submit an application and pay the prescribed fees – no questions asked. In her speech in Parliament on the Bill on Wednesday, Ms Sun said there have been about 1,400 applications in the last five years, with about half of them submitted via the automatic route. She said there were instances where the registrar needed information to ascertain whether applications under this route did not fall within the sensitive categories listed in the Act. But it could not do so, as the Act previously did not allow the registrar to ask questions. Ms Sun added that even if an application did not fall under the sensitive categories, it could still be of concern. And yet, the registrar previously had no authority to reject such applications. She gave a hypothetical example of how a group of individuals with antecedents of concern may try to set up a society to advocate for the interests of a racial group. Ms Sun said the individuals would know that if they were to set up a society promoting the interests of a particular race, they would have to do so via the normal route. The registrar would be able to scrutinise their application, and ask questions to clarify their objectives and leadership composition. She said: “To avoid being questioned, this group tries to set up a society with an innocuous aim, such as a history interest group.” Ms Sun said that in such a scenario, the law previously would have enabled such a group to get approval immediately. But the amendments will now enable the registrar to ask questions and reject such applications. Those rejected may appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs, and, if rejected again, may then launch a judicial review. Other administrative matters that the amendments cover include allowing the registrar, instead of the Minister for Home Affairs, to declare a person unfit to be an officer of a society. The sections of the Act dealing with offences have also been updated by the amendments, increasing the fine quantum, and allowing for the registrar to compound offences as an alternative to charging offenders in court. Ms Sun said the review of the penalties was necessary to ensure the deterrent effect of the laws, as the last review of the Societies Act was in 2004. Workers’ Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) asked if there had been applications that were approved via the automatic route that should not have been approved because they posed a security threat. Ms Sun said there have not been any such approvals, but there were three applications that were submitted via the automatic route that had raised concerns, as the applicants had some antecedents. The applicants, however, for reasons unknown, did not pursue their applications to completion, said Ms Sun. She added that for operational reasons, she was unable to share further details about the applications. Mr Giam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) and Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok) had also asked questions in relation to application rejections. Ms Sun said that in the past five years, a total of 53 applications were rejected, making up 3.7 per cent of all applications. She said the applications were rejected for various reasons. She said: “An application may be rejected if the society is likely to be used for unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore. Or that it would be contrary to national security or interest for the society to be registered.” Ms Sun added that the amendments were necessary for Singapore to remain relevant amid the regional and global landscape. She said: “We have seen geopolitical tensions, we have seen the possibility of foreign interference through various entities. We’ll have to make sure that we have the levers, and that societies are not used for purposes that are prejudicial to good order, security, peace and harmony in Singapore.”</td>\n",

the normal or the automatic route. applications for societies related to religion, ethnicity, language and politics, which are known as specified societies, go through the normal route. this means a vetting and assessment process, which may involve several rounds of clarifications with applicants. all other societies are registered automatically when they submit an application and pay the prescribed fees – no questions asked. in her speech in parliament on the bill on wednesday, ms sun said there have been about 1,400 applications in the last five years, with about half of them submitted via the automatic route. she said there were instances where the registrar needed information to ascertain whether applications under this route did not fall within the sensitive categories listed in the act. but it could not do so, as the act previously did not allow the registrar to ask questions. ms sun added that even if an application did not fall under the sensitive categories, it could still be of concern. and yet, the registrar previously had no authority to reject such applications. she gave a hypothetical example of how a group of individuals with antecedents of concern may try to set up a society to advocate for the interests of a racial group. ms sun said the individuals would know that if they were to set up a society promoting the interests of a particular race, they would have to do so via the normal route. the registrar would be able to scrutinise their application, and ask questions to clarify their objectives and leadership composition. she said: “to avoid being questioned, this group tries to set up a society with an innocuous aim, such as a history interest group.” ms sun said that in such a scenario, the law previously would have enabled such a group to get approval immediately. but the amendments will now enable the registrar to ask questions and reject such applications. those rejected may appeal to the minister for home affairs, and, if rejected again, may then launch a judicial review. other administrative matters that the amendments cover include allowing the registrar, instead of the minister for home affairs, to declare a person unfit to be an officer of a society. the sections of the act dealing with offences have also been updated by the amendments, increasing the fine quantum, and allowing for the registrar to compound offences as an alternative to charging offenders in court. ms sun said the review of the penalties was necessary to ensure the deterrent effect of the laws, as the last review of the societies act was in 2004. workers’ party mp gerald giam (aljunied grc) asked if there had been applications that were approved via the automatic route that should not have been approved because they posed a security threat. ms sun said there have not been any such approvals, but there were three applications that were submitted via the automatic route that had raised concerns, as the applicants had some antecedents. the applicants, however, for reasons unknown, did not pursue their applications to completion, said ms sun. she added that for operational reasons, she was unable to share further details about the applications. mr giam, ms nadia ahmad samdin (ang mo kio grc) and mr murali pillai (bukit batok) had also asked questions in relation to application rejections. ms sun said that in the past five years, a total of 53 applications were rejected, making up 3.7 per cent of all applications. she said the applications were rejected for various reasons. she said: “an application may be rejected if the society is likely to be used for unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in singapore. or that it would be contrary to national security or interest for the society to be registered.” ms sun added that the amendments were necessary for singapore to remain relevant amid the regional and global landscape. she said: “we have seen geopolitical tensions, we have seen the possibility of foreign interference through various entities. we’ll have to make sure that we have the levers, and that societies are not used for purposes that are prejudicial to good order, security, peace and harmony in singapore.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>At the Bidadari Housing Board (HDB) estate, nature is just a stroll away. In fact, Mr Firdaus Subagio, Madam Nazatul Shima Zahir and their two sons, Sayf Iman and Saqyf Ihsan, live right next to nature. Their 4-room flat at Woodleigh Glen in the estate is situated beside a soon-to-be-completed park on a hillock. Watch to learn how the Housing Board integrates its developments with the surrounding environment. “We like how peaceful and quiet the area is,” says the 31-year-old operations manager. “As a former outdoor educator, I like to expose my family to the outdoors and share with them the different types of flora and fauna. The kids love to cycle and visit the playground and common areas, which are filled with greenery. Hopefully, when the park and the nearby lake are open, we can bring them over to explore and learn more about nature.” In planning and designing Bidadari, HDB discussed with Nature Society (Singapore) ways to best preserve the estate’s biodiversity while meeting Singapore’s housing needs, and took on board their suggestions where feasible. This included keeping a one-hectare hillock (about the size of one and a half football fields) as a stopover site for migratory birds, retaining the heritage trees in the hillock, and constructing a 19-metre-wide land bridge to be an eco-link between Bidadari Park and the hillock. Across its various towns and estates, HDB has worked at balancing building homes with conserving the areas’ biodiversity, tapping and enhancing existing natural features to enable residents to live in tranquil surroundings, with convenient amenities close by. HDB's group director of research and planning Chong Fook Loong says: “As the largest master planner and housing developer in Singapore, we seek to create high-quality living environments where residents can live well, live green and live connected. We do this by planning for greenery and sustainable features that can help improve residents’ quality of life, and unique community spaces that encourage physical activity and social interaction. “With our partners’ help, we hope to cater to different needs, balance between development and conservation, and ensure our towns and estates remain green and beautiful. This way, residents can love and enjoy the area that they live in.” Using science to boost sustainability For years, HDB has made in-depth environmental baseline and impact studies part of its standard practice in developing new housing areas. Consultants survey an area over time and take stock of the wildlife, natural habitats and other biodiversity. Mr Yeo Guan Him, the deputy director of project development and management in the building quality group at HDB, has worked on various Build-To-Order projects, including McNair Towers, Buangkok Woods and Keat Hong Verge. He has personally seen how these studies lend the agency a different perspective, which can guide it to build higher quality and more liveable estates. He explains: “The information from these studies help us determine how best we can preserve existing biodiversity and mitigate the impact of the developments on the environment.” For example, HDB incorporated green corridors – continuous green passages – in Punggol Northshore to maintain its ecological balance and promote biodiversity. New habitats such as dragonfly ponds, bird sanctuaries and butterfly gardens are introduced along the green corridors to attract diverse species. In the future, those who live in the Tengah HDB town can immerse themselves in greenery in many ways too. They can hike in a forest corridor that stretches about 5km long and 100m wide, relax with friends and family in a central park with ponds and canals, and try their hand at gardening and urban farming in community farmways. In Woodlands North, where HDB will develop more public housing, an environmental study found an area spanning over four hectares, the equivalent of about six football fields, worthy of conservation due to its rare and native plants, and freshwater stream. “With this knowledge, we could decisively adjust our plans,” says Dr Chong. Where necessary, the authority also engages a specialist to come up with an environmental management and monitoring plan to curb any potential environmental impact from infrastructure works. This could include guiding wildlife away from the site to nearby forests before starting the development. He notes: “With this science-based approach, we ensure that we take Singapore’s limited resources into consideration. Then, we can make trade-off decisions in the most informed manner for projects across a wide variety of land-use needs.” Listening and learning more More recently, HDB, together with other government agencies, has stepped up conversations with communities and people who are passionate about Singapore’s natural and built heritage, including residents, nature enthusiasts and heritage groups, to listen to their feedback on its plans. For instance, it used the findings from the environmental baseline study, as well as subsequent feedback from nature groups and the public, to revise the urban planning and design strategies for Ulu Pandan, taking a holistic and science-based approach to balance development and nature conservation. The revised conceptual plans also took into consideration the findings from NParks’ Ecological Profiling Exercise (EPE). Considering the feedback and its comparatively richer biodiversity, a decision was made to retain the western half of Ulu Pandan as is in the medium term. The plans for the area will be reviewed sometime around 2030, taking into consideration Singapore’s land use needs at that time. In the meantime, a nature park within this part of the site, will be safeguarded to serve as a natural habitat and ecological corridor between Clementi Forest and the Southern Ridges. “This park will also complement the connectivity along the Rail Corridor in the vicinity of Ulu Pandan, which is one of two ecological corridors identified in NParks’ EPE. We are proposing other green features, such as about five hectares of greenery on the eastern side of the site and along Ulu Pandan Canal for park and recreational use, and a linear park along the canal too,” Dr Chong elaborates. Building for the future Ultimately, one of HDB’s key goals is to integrate natural elements into its development plans, and its developments into their green surroundings. “At the macro level, we try to preserve pockets of space where we can. We also go down to the micro level to look at things like how to protect trees and species we know are important,” he says. With these efforts, Singapore could become greener as it grows denser. For residents like Mr Firdaus and his family, the proof is in the verdant greenery all around them. In Bidadari, which was built with the vision of “A Community in a Garden”, the Bidadari Park alone occupies 10 ha, more than a tenth of the estate’s land area, and is home to more than 350 conserved mature trees and 2,000 new trees that include critically endangered varieties. Nestled seamlessly within the site’s lush and hilly landscape, it is also a sanctuary for wildlife, with its shrubs, trees, flowering plants and connections to other nature ways facilitating their movement around the park and to other parts of Singapore. Dr Chong shares: “The world has become more environmentally conscious, more in tune with the built environment’s impact on flora and fauna. When we talk about sustainability, it’s thinking about how to better preserve the natural heritage that has been given to us, and making sure that future generations can enjoy the environment we grew up in.” Find out how HDB plans and builds its housing estates. Also, read more on how it works with trusted companies to deliver homes that meet people's needs and desires.</td>\n",

The full year increase for HDB resale prices last year was 6.6 per cent, the lowest in five years. The HDB released its flash estimate of the Resale Price Index early this morning. The index provides information on the general price movements in the public residential market. The Board added that it will now target to launch at least 23,000 Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in 2013 in various towns. The first batch of 3,346 BTO flats in Choa Chu Kang, Yishun, Hougang, Tampines, Kallang Whampoa, and Ang Mo Kio will be offered for sale later this month. More details on public housing data for the fourth quarter will be released on Jan 25.   \n",

16-year-old boy in connection with a series of break-ins at houses located at Thomson Hills Drive and Sembawang Hills Drive. The cases were committed between Christmas and Jan 1 this year. The suspect is believed to have stolen cash amounting to more than $800 on three separate occasions by climbing through unlocked windows of the homes. He was nabbed after officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division conducted extensive inquiries in the area. Their efforts paid off when they managed to establish the suspect's identity and on Jan 3 arrested him in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4. Follow up investigations indicate that he was also responsible for a similar break-in committed on Jan 2 at a unit located along Sembawang Hills Drive where cash and a watch were stolen. Police have since recovered the stolen watch.   \n",

                                             The Clementi Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) rolled out its Community Policing System (Cops) today. First implemented in Tampines and Bukit Merah East in May last year, Cops is what the Singapore Police Force calls \"a nation-wide transformation of frontline policing strategies\" which aims to improve police force and community integration. The system employs two recent major changes to the NPCs' manpower, one of which is having Crime Strike Forces of plainclothes policemen to patrol crime hotspots daily, gather intelligence and track the whereabouts of persons of interest within the community. Policemen in T-shirts and shorts also form the Community Policing Unit on bikes and on foot, getting to know the neighbourhood's residents and helping to foster a more community-engaged policing culture. Clementi is part of the second phase of Cops roll-outs, and by the end of this month, five additional NPCs would also have adopted the system. They are Bishan, Punggol, Sengkang, Woodlands East and Woodlands West. Announcing the latest launch today was Minister (Prime Minister's Office) and Second Minister (Home Affairs and Trade & Industry) S Iswaran, who said that all NPCs will be under this system by 2016. In addition to community policing, Clementi also officially introduced its \"West Coast Protectors\" this morning - a residents' watch group with trained volunteers who help protect the neighbourhood through regular patrols and exchanging information with the police. Mr Iswaran urged residents to continue to raise community vigilance against crime.   \n",

Jurong West, Jurong East and Boon Lay, was arrested by police at 4pm today. The man had snatched the gold necklaces of his elderly victims between mid December last year to early January this year. The suspect is expected to be charged in court on Wednesday. If charged, he may face a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years. The serial snatch thief is also liable for caning. The commander of Jurong Police Division, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Wilson Lim, said members of the public should remain alert and wary of suspicious individuals. They should also avoid ostentatious displays of wealth.   \n",

The 30-year-old father was sentenced to 10 months and three weeks’ jail after he pleaded guilty on Wednesday to offences including two counts of assault involving the seven-year-old boy. He cannot be named as there is a gag order to protect his son’s identity. The man was convicted of an unrelated assault charge in 2015 and sentenced to a month in jail. Four years later, he was convicted of a snatch theft and sentenced to a year behind bars. The current case happened on the afternoon of Jan 7, 2023. He flew into a rage in his Rivervale Crescent flat in Sengkang when he thought that his two sons – the victim and his younger brother – were not sleeping during their supposed nap time. His 27-year-old wife was at work at the time, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Melissa Heng. The father used a belt to repeatedly strike his older son on the right ear, shoulder, upper back and neck in one of the bedrooms at around 3pm that day. He stopped the beating when the child apologised. His wife came home about two hours later and saw red marks on their son’s body. After the boy told his mother about the assault, she made a police report. An ambulance later took him to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, where he was found with multiple bruises on his body, including his upper back. He was given medical leave from Jan 7 to 9. The mother then applied for an expedited order, which is a temporary personal protection order. It was granted by a district judge on Jan 10. The DPP said the order restrained the man from using violence against his wife, the victim and his younger son. The man was out on bail when he targeted the older son again on May 14. DPP Heng said: “The accused insisted that the victim had homework to complete. When the victim said that he did not have any, the accused said he was lying.” The accused then slapped the victim on his chest, face and arm, and punched him once in the abdomen, she added. The victim’s mother alerted the police at around 3.30pm. Officers arrested the man on May 14. He was released on bail two days later. He continued to reoffend on July 5 after the police attended to another call from his wife that day. Details about this call were not disclosed in court documents. When officers were talking to the offender outside his flat, a 26-year-old man came forward and asked to speak to him. The younger man’s name has been redacted from court documents. The officers allowed the two men to speak and they went to a nearby staircase landing. It turned out the offender had been involved in an earlier dispute with the other man’s father. When they started exchanging blows, the officers intervened and arrested the offender after stopping the fight. He was in a police vehicle heading towards Woodlands Division Regional Lockup when he hurled vulgarities at the officers, including asking a policeman if he wanted the offender’s leg to “fly” to his face.   \n",

The amendments include introducing a licensing regime on FTZ operators, new regulations on cargo handlers and more enforcement powers for Customs authorities, Senior Minister of State for Finance Chee Hong Tat said in Parliament on Wednesday. FTZs are designated areas where goods can be stored, handled and distributed without being subject to Customs duties or taxes. They play a vital role in strengthening Singapore’s position as the world’s largest transhipment hub. The Bill to amend the Act was tabled in Parliament on Sept 18. Mr Chee said the changes are necessary amid growing concerns that FTZs are being “misused for illicit activities such as weapons proliferation, environmental crimes and trade-based money laundering”. He added that perpetrators try to mask such illegal activities as legitimate trade. Examples include providing false or inaccurate information on a cargo shipment or by swopping legitimate goods with contraband before re-exporting. Singapore is the second busiest container port in the world and the largest transhipment hub, handling about a fifth of the world’s container transhipment traffic. Several MPs, including Associate Professor Jamus Lim of the Workers’ Party, Mr Shawn Huang (Jurong GRC), Mr Edward Chia (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) and Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang GRC), questioned the adequacy of the amendments. Mr Chee replied that criminals will always find new ways to circumvent the rules. To keep pace with evolving threats and the increasing sophistication of these criminals, Singapore has to “remain vigilant and strengthen its regulatory framework to detect and deter illicit trade”. As many FTZ operators are now private entities, Mr Chee said introducing a new licensing regime requiring them to go through an approval process is appropriate, as this will ensure that only those who meet the requirements are awarded licences. While cargo handlers and agents do not have to apply for licences, the proposed amendments seek to regulate and clearly lay out their responsibilities, which include monitoring and managing the movement of goods at their premises. They will also need to provide data on all goods passing through Singapore. Currently, only information on imported, exported or controlled goods is required. Mr Chee said this will enable better visibility of goods going through the Republic. “Customs can monitor the flows of goods for signs of illicit activity, and take the necessary action in close partnership with other international authorities.” The amendments proposed also seek to enhance the enforcement powers of Customs authorities. This includes allowing the Director-General of Customs to grant, renew, suspend or revoke licences, as well as impose or modify licensing conditions, order the removal of dangerous goods, and detain goods for inspection. Mr Chee addressed MPs’ concerns about the impact of the revised regulations on business costs, operational efficiency and Singapore’s overall competitiveness as a trading hub. He emphasised that Singapore wants to facilitate trade and maintain a business-friendly operating environment. However, it should not be misused by bad actors for their illegal activities. “The proposed amendments seek to strike the right balance between better governance and preserving our pro-business environment,” he said.  Mr Chee said the Government consulted industry stakeholders to make sure the changes are designed and implemented in a way that will minimise the costs and compliance burden for companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises.  Implementation of the provisions under the revised Act will be phased in from early 2024. Companies will also have a six-month period to adjust to the changes, Mr Chee added. “Today, we seek to formalise these amendments into law and, in doing so, put Singapore on a stronger footing to combat illicit trade and remain a critical node in global trade flows. This will help Singapore to safeguard our position as a global trade hub,” Mr Chee said.   \n",

But with the evolving geopolitical landscape, Singapore will need more levers to guard against such threats, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling. Parliament passed the Societies (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday, enacting changes to the Societies Act that will enable Singapore to better guard against such groups. The changes aim to strengthen the registration process and give more powers to the Registrar of Societies to ask questions and weed out suspicious applications. Previously, applications to register societies were processed by either the normal or the automatic route. Applications for societies related to religion, ethnicity, language and politics, which are known as specified societies, go through the normal route. This means a vetting and assessment process, which may involve several rounds of clarifications with applicants. All other societies are registered automatically when they submit an application and pay the prescribed fees – no questions asked. In her speech in Parliament on the Bill on Wednesday, Ms Sun said there have been about 1,400 applications in the last five years, with about half of them submitted via the automatic route. She said there were instances where the registrar needed information to ascertain whether applications under this route did not fall within the sensitive categories listed in the Act. But it could not do so, as the Act previously did not allow the registrar to ask questions. Ms Sun added that even if an application did not fall under the sensitive categories, it could still be of concern. And yet, the registrar previously had no authority to reject such applications. She gave a hypothetical example of how a group of individuals with antecedents of concern may try to set up a society to advocate for the interests of a racial group. Ms Sun said the individuals would know that if they were to set up a society promoting the interests of a particular race, they would have to do so via the normal route. The registrar would be able to scrutinise their application, and ask questions to clarify their objectives and leadership composition. She said: “To avoid being questioned, this group tries to set up a society with an innocuous aim, such as a history interest group.” Ms Sun said that in such a scenario, the law previously would have enabled such a group to get approval immediately. But the amendments will now enable the registrar to ask questions and reject such applications. Those rejected may appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs, and, if rejected again, may then launch a judicial review. Other administrative matters that the amendments cover include allowing the registrar, instead of the Minister for Home Affairs, to declare a person unfit to be an officer of a society. The sections of the Act dealing with offences have also been updated by the amendments, increasing the fine quantum, and allowing for the registrar to compound offences as an alternative to charging offenders in court. Ms Sun said the review of the penalties was necessary to ensure the deterrent effect of the laws, as the last review of the Societies Act was in 2004. Workers’ Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) asked if there had been applications that were approved via the automatic route that should not have been approved because they posed a security threat. Ms Sun said there have not been any such approvals, but there were three applications that were submitted via the automatic route that had raised concerns, as the applicants had some antecedents. The applicants, however, for reasons unknown, did not pursue their applications to completion, said Ms Sun. She added that for operational reasons, she was unable to share further details about the applications. Mr Giam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) and Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok) had also asked questions in relation to application rejections. Ms Sun said that in the past five years, a total of 53 applications were rejected, making up 3.7 per cent of all applications. She said the applications were rejected for various reasons. She said: “An application may be rejected if the society is likely to be used for unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore. Or that it would be contrary to national security or interest for the society to be registered.” Ms Sun added that the amendments were necessary for Singapore to remain relevant amid the regional and global landscape. She said: “We have seen geopolitical tensions, we have seen the possibility of foreign interference through various entities. We’ll have to make sure that we have the levers, and that societies are not used for purposes that are prejudicial to good order, security, peace and harmony in Singapore.”   \n",

       "29671  At the Bidadari Housing Board (HDB) estate, nature is just a stroll away. In fact, Mr Firdaus Subagio, Madam Nazatul Shima Zahir and their two sons, Sayf Iman and Saqyf Ihsan, live right next to nature. Their 4-room flat at Woodleigh Glen in the estate is situated beside a soon-to-be-completed park on a hillock. Watch to learn how the Housing Board integrates its developments with the surrounding environment. “We like how peaceful and quiet the area is,” says the 31-year-old operations manager. “As a former outdoor educator, I like to expose my family to the outdoors and share with them the different types of flora and fauna. The kids love to cycle and visit the playground and common areas, which are filled with greenery. Hopefully, when the park and the nearby lake are open, we can bring them over to explore and learn more about nature.” In planning and designing Bidadari, HDB discussed with Nature Society (Singapore) ways to best preserve the estate’s biodiversity while meeting Singapore’s housing needs, and took on board their suggestions where feasible. This included keeping a one-hectare hillock (about the size of one and a half football fields) as a stopover site for migratory birds, retaining the heritage trees in the hillock, and constructing a 19-metre-wide land bridge to be an eco-link between Bidadari Park and the hillock. Across its various towns and estates, HDB has worked at balancing building homes with conserving the areas’ biodiversity, tapping and enhancing existing natural features to enable residents to live in tranquil surroundings, with convenient amenities close by. HDB's group director of research and planning Chong Fook Loong says: “As the largest master planner and housing developer in Singapore, we seek to create high-quality living environments where residents can live well, live green and live connected. We do this by planning for greenery and sustainable features that can help improve residents’ quality of life, and unique community spaces that encourage physical activity and social interaction. “With our partners’ help, we hope to cater to different needs, balance between development and conservation, and ensure our towns and estates remain green and beautiful. This way, residents can love and enjoy the area that they live in.” Using science to boost sustainability For years, HDB has made in-depth environmental baseline and impact studies part of its standard practice in developing new housing areas. Consultants survey an area over time and take stock of the wildlife, natural habitats and other biodiversity. Mr Yeo Guan Him, the deputy director of project development and management in the building quality group at HDB, has worked on various Build-To-Order projects, including McNair Towers, Buangkok Woods and Keat Hong Verge. He has personally seen how these studies lend the agency a different perspective, which can guide it to build higher quality and more liveable estates. He explains: “The information from these studies help us determine how best we can preserve existing biodiversity and mitigate the impact of the developments on the environment.” For example, HDB incorporated green corridors – continuous green passages – in Punggol Northshore to maintain its ecological balance and promote biodiversity. New habitats such as dragonfly ponds, bird sanctuaries and butterfly gardens are introduced along the green corridors to attract diverse species. In the future, those who live in the Tengah HDB town can immerse themselves in greenery in many ways too. They can hike in a forest corridor that stretches about 5km long and 100m wide, relax with friends and family in a central park with ponds and canals, and try their hand at gardening and urban farming in community farmways. In Woodlands North, where HDB will develop more public housing, an environmental study found an area spanning over four hectares, the equivalent of about six football fields, worthy of conservation due to its rare and native plants, and freshwater stream. “With this knowledge, we could decisively adjust our plans,” says Dr Chong. Where necessary, the authority also engages a specialist to come up with an environmental management and monitoring plan to curb any potential environmental impact from infrastructure works. This could include guiding wildlife away from the site to nearby forests before starting the development. He notes: “With this science-based approach, we ensure that we take Singapore’s limited resources into consideration. Then, we can make trade-off decisions in the most informed manner for projects across a wide variety of land-use needs.” Listening and learning more More recently, HDB, together with other government agencies, has stepped up conversations with communities and people who are passionate about Singapore’s natural and built heritage, including residents, nature enthusiasts and heritage groups, to listen to their feedback on its plans. For instance, it used the findings from the environmental baseline study, as well as subsequent feedback from nature groups and the public, to revise the urban planning and design strategies for Ulu Pandan, taking a holistic and science-based approach to balance development and nature conservation. The revised conceptual plans also took into consideration the findings from NParks’ Ecological Profiling Exercise (EPE). Considering the feedback and its comparatively richer biodiversity, a decision was made to retain the western half of Ulu Pandan as is in the medium term. The plans for the area will be reviewed sometime around 2030, taking into consideration Singapore’s land use needs at that time. In the meantime, a nature park within this part of the site, will be safeguarded to serve as a natural habitat and ecological corridor between Clementi Forest and the Southern Ridges. “This park will also complement the connectivity along the Rail Corridor in the vicinity of Ulu Pandan, which is one of two ecological corridors identified in NParks’ EPE. We are proposing other green features, such as about five hectares of greenery on the eastern side of the site and along Ulu Pandan Canal for park and recreational use, and a linear park along the canal too,” Dr Chong elaborates. Building for the future Ultimately, one of HDB’s key goals is to integrate natural elements into its development plans, and its developments into their green surroundings. “At the macro level, we try to preserve pockets of space where we can. We also go down to the micro level to look at things like how to protect trees and species we know are important,” he says. With these efforts, Singapore could become greener as it grows denser. For residents like Mr Firdaus and his family, the proof is in the verdant greenery all around them. In Bidadari, which was built with the vision of “A Community in a Garden”, the Bidadari Park alone occupies 10 ha, more than a tenth of the estate’s land area, and is home to more than 350 conserved mature trees and 2,000 new trees that include critically endangered varieties. Nestled seamlessly within the site’s lush and hilly landscape, it is also a sanctuary for wildlife, with its shrubs, trees, flowering plants and connections to other nature ways facilitating their movement around the park and to other parts of Singapore. Dr Chong shares: “The world has become more environmentally conscious, more in tune with the built environment’s impact on flora and fauna.

                                             the clementi neighbourhood police centre (npc) rolled out its community policing system (cops) today. first implemented in tampines and bukit merah east in may last year, cops is what the singapore police force calls \"a nation-wide transformation of frontline policing strategies\" which aims to improve police force and community integration. the system employs two recent major changes to the npcs' manpower, one of which is having crime strike forces of plainclothes policemen to patrol crime hotspots daily, gather intelligence and track the whereabouts of persons of interest within the community. policemen in t-shirts and shorts also form the community policing unit on bikes and on foot, getting to know the neighbourhood's residents and helping to foster a more community-engaged policing culture. clementi is part of the second phase of cops roll-outs, and by the end of this month, five additional npcs would also have adopted the system. they are bishan, punggol, sengkang, woodlands east and woodlands west. announcing the latest launch today was minister (prime minister's office) and second minister (home affairs and trade & industry) s iswaran, who said that all npcs will be under this system by 2016. in addition to community policing, clementi also officially introduced its \"west coast protectors\" this morning - a residents' watch group with trained volunteers who help protect the neighbourhood through regular patrols and exchanging information with the police. mr iswaran urged residents to continue to raise community vigilance against crime.   \n",

a recalcitrant offender whipped his son with a belt about 20 times in january, and then punched him in the abdomen in may despite a protection order prohibiting him from doing so. the 30-year-old father was sentenced to 10 months and three weeks’ jail after he pleaded guilty on wednesday to offences including two counts of assault involving the seven-year-old boy. he cannot be named as there is a gag order to protect his son’s identity. the man was convicted of an unrelated assault charge in 2015 and sentenced to a month in jail. four years later, he was convicted of a snatch theft and sentenced to a year behind bars. the current case happened on the afternoon of jan 7, 2023. he flew into a rage in his rivervale crescent flat in sengkang when he thought that his two sons – the victim and his younger brother – were not sleeping during their supposed nap time. his 27-year-old wife was at work at the time, said deputy public prosecutor melissa heng. the father used a belt to repeatedly strike his older son on the right ear, shoulder, upper back and neck in one of the bedrooms at around 3pm that day. he stopped the beating when the child apologised. his wife came home about two hours later and saw red marks on their son’s body. after the boy told his mother about the assault, she made a police report. an ambulance later took him to kk women’s and children’s hospital, where he was found with multiple bruises on his body, including his upper back. he was given medical leave from jan 7 to 9. the mother then applied for an expedited order, which is a temporary personal protection order. it was granted by a district judge on jan 10. the dpp said the order restrained the man from using violence against his wife, the victim and his younger son. the man was out on bail when he targeted the older son again on may 14. dpp heng said: “the accused insisted that the victim had homework to complete. when the victim said that he did not have any, the accused said he was lying.” the accused then slapped the victim on his chest, face and arm, and punched him once in the abdomen, she added. the victim’s mother alerted the police at around 3.30pm. officers arrested the man on may 14. he was released on bail two days later. he continued to reoffend on july 5 after the police attended to another call from his wife that day. details about this call were not disclosed in court documents. when officers were talking to the offender outside his flat, a 26-year-old man came forward and asked to speak to him. the younger man’s name has been redacted from court documents. the officers allowed the two men to speak and they went to a nearby staircase landing. it turned out the offender had been involved in an earlier dispute with the other man’s father. when they started exchanging blows, the officers intervened and arrested the offender after stopping the fight. he was in a police vehicle heading towards woodlands division regional lockup when he hurled vulgarities at the officers, including asking a policeman if he wanted the offender’s leg to “fly” to his face.   \n",

the republic is making amendments to the free trade zones act to enhance regulation and control of goods that flow through the 10 free-trade zones (ftzs) in the country. the amendments include introducing a licensing regime on ftz operators, new regulations on cargo handlers and more enforcement powers for customs authorities, senior minister of state for finance chee hong tat said in parliament on wednesday. ftzs are designated areas where goods can be stored, handled and distributed without being subject to customs duties or taxes. they play a vital role in strengthening singapore’s position as the world’s largest transhipment hub. the bill to amend the act was tabled in parliament on sept 18. mr chee said the changes are necessary amid growing concerns that ftzs are being “misused for illicit activities such as weapons proliferation, environmental crimes and trade-based money laundering”. he added that perpetrators try to mask such illegal activities as legitimate trade. examples include providing false or inaccurate information on a cargo shipment or by swopping legitimate goods with contraband before re-exporting. singapore is the second busiest container port in the world and the largest transhipment hub, handling about a fifth of the world’s container transhipment traffic. several mps, including associate professor jamus lim of the workers’ party, mr shawn huang (jurong grc), mr edward chia (holland-bukit timah grc) and ms mariam jaafar (sembawang grc), questioned the adequacy of the amendments. mr chee replied that criminals will always find new ways to circumvent the rules. to keep pace with evolving threats and the increasing sophistication of these criminals, singapore has to “remain vigilant and strengthen its regulatory framework to detect and deter illicit trade”. as many ftz operators are now private entities, mr chee said introducing a new licensing regime requiring them to go through an approval process is appropriate, as this will ensure that only those who meet the requirements are awarded licences. while cargo handlers and agents do not have to apply for licences, the proposed amendments seek to regulate and clearly lay out their responsibilities, which include monitoring and managing the movement of goods at their premises. they will also need to provide data on all goods passing through singapore. currently, only information on imported, exported or controlled goods is required. mr chee said this will enable better visibility of goods going through the republic. “customs can monitor the flows of goods for signs of illicit activity, and take the necessary action in close partnership with other international authorities.” the amendments proposed also seek to enhance the enforcement powers of customs authorities. this includes allowing the director-general of customs to grant, renew, suspend or revoke licences, as well as impose or modify licensing conditions, order the removal of dangerous goods, and detain goods for inspection. mr chee addressed mps’ concerns about the impact of the revised regulations on business costs, operational efficiency and singapore’s overall competitiveness as a trading hub. he emphasised that singapore wants to facilitate trade and maintain a business-friendly operating environment. however, it should not be misused by bad actors for their illegal activities. “the proposed amendments seek to strike the right balance between better governance and preserving our pro-business environment,” he said.  mr chee said the government consulted industry stakeholders to make sure the changes are designed and implemented in a way that will minimise the costs and compliance burden for companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises.  implementation of the provisions under the revised act will be phased in from early 2024. companies will also have a six-month period to adjust to the changes, mr chee added. “today, we seek to formalise these amendments into law and, in doing so, put singapore on a stronger footing to combat illicit trade and remain a critical node in global trade flows. this will help singapore to safeguard our position as a global trade hub,” mr chee said.   \n",

societies that may be used for unlawful purposes, threaten singapore’s safety and security, or whose activities are contrary to the republic’s national interests, are not allowed to establish themselves here. but with the evolving geopolitical landscape, singapore will need more levers to guard against such threats, said minister of state for home affairs sun xueling. parliament passed the societies (amendment) bill on wednesday, enacting changes to the societies act that will enable singapore to better guard against such groups. the changes aim to strengthen the registration process and give more powers to the registrar of societies to ask questions and weed out suspicious applications. previously, applications to register societies were processed by either the normal or the automatic route. applications for societies related to religion, ethnicity, language and politics, which are known as specified societies, go through the normal route. this means a vetting and assessment process, which may involve several rounds of clarifications with applicants. all other societies are registered automatically when they submit an application and pay the prescribed fees – no questions asked. in her speech in parliament on the bill on wednesday, ms sun said there have been about 1,400 applications in the last five years, with about half of them submitted via the automatic route. she said there were instances where the registrar needed information to ascertain whether applications under this route did not fall within the sensitive categories listed in the act. but it could not do so, as the act previously did not allow the registrar to ask questions. ms sun added that even if an application did not fall under the sensitive categories, it could still be of concern. and yet, the registrar previously had no authority to reject such applications. she gave a hypothetical example of how a group of individuals with antecedents of concern may try to set up a society to advocate for the interests of a racial group. ms sun said the individuals would know that if they were to set up a society promoting the interests of a particular race, they would have to do so via the normal route. the registrar would be able to scrutinise their application, and ask questions to clarify their objectives and leadership composition. she said: “to avoid being questioned, this group tries to set up a society with an innocuous aim, such as a history interest group.” ms sun said that in such a scenario, the law previously would have enabled such a group to get approval immediately. but the amendments will now enable the registrar to ask questions and reject such applications. those rejected may appeal to the minister for home affairs, and, if rejected again, may then launch a judicial review. other administrative matters that the amendments cover include allowing the registrar, instead of the minister for home affairs, to declare a person unfit to be an officer of a society. the sections of the act dealing with offences have also been updated by the amendments, increasing the fine quantum, and allowing for the registrar to compound offences as an alternative to charging offenders in court. ms sun said the review of the penalties was necessary to ensure the deterrent effect of the laws, as the last review of the societies act was in 2004. workers’ party mp gerald giam (aljunied grc) asked if there had been applications that were approved via the automatic route that should not have been approved because they posed a security threat. ms sun said there have not been any such approvals, but there were three applications that were submitted via the automatic route that had raised concerns, as the applicants had some antecedents. the applicants, however, for reasons unknown, did not pursue their applications to completion, said ms sun. she added that for operational reasons, she was unable to share further details about the applications. mr giam, ms nadia ahmad samdin (ang mo kio grc) and mr murali pillai (bukit batok) had also asked questions in relation to application rejections. ms sun said that in the past five years, a total of 53 applications were rejected, making up 3.7 per cent of all applications. she said the applications were rejected for various reasons. she said: “an application may be rejected if the society is likely to be used for unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in singapore. or that it would be contrary to national security or interest for the society to be registered.” ms sun added that the amendments were necessary for singapore to remain relevant amid the regional and global landscape. she said: “we have seen geopolitical tensions, we have seen the possibility of foreign interference through various entities. we’ll have to make sure that we have the levers, and that societies are not used for purposes that are prejudicial to good order, security, peace and harmony in singapore.”   \n",

       "29671  at the bidadari housing board (hdb) estate, nature is just a stroll away. in fact, mr firdaus subagio, madam nazatul shima zahir and their two sons, sayf iman and saqyf ihsan, live right next to nature. their 4-room flat at woodleigh glen in the estate is situated beside a soon-to-be-completed park on a hillock. watch to learn how the housing board integrates its developments with the surrounding environment. “we like how peaceful and quiet the area is,” says the 31-year-old operations manager. “as a former outdoor educator, i like to expose my family to the outdoors and share with them the different types of flora and fauna. the kids love to cycle and visit the playground and common areas, which are filled with greenery. hopefully, when the park and the nearby lake are open, we can bring them over to explore and learn more about nature.” in planning and designing bidadari, hdb discussed with nature society (singapore) ways to best preserve the estate’s biodiversity while meeting singapore’s housing needs, and took on board their suggestions where feasible. this included keeping a one-hectare hillock (about the size of one and a half football fields) as a stopover site for migratory birds, retaining the heritage trees in the hillock, and constructing a 19-metre-wide land bridge to be an eco-link between bidadari park and the hillock. across its various towns and estates, hdb has worked at balancing building homes with conserving the areas’ biodiversity, tapping and enhancing existing natural features to enable residents to live in tranquil surroundings, with convenient amenities close by. hdb's group director of research and planning chong fook loong says: “as the largest master planner and housing developer in singapore, we seek to create high-quality living environments where residents can live well, live green and live connected. we do this by planning for greenery and sustainable features that can help improve residents’ quality of life, and unique community spaces that encourage physical activity and social interaction. “with our partners’ help, we hope to cater to different needs, balance between development and conservation, and ensure our towns and estates remain green and beautiful. this way, residents can love and enjoy the area that they live in.” using science to boost sustainability for years, hdb has made in-depth environmental baseline and impact studies part of its standard practice in developing new housing areas. consultants survey an area over time and take stock of the wildlife, natural habitats and other biodiversity. mr yeo guan him, the deputy director of project development and management in the building quality group at hdb, has worked on various build-to-order projects, including mcnair towers, buangkok woods and keat hong verge. he has personally seen how these studies lend the agency a different perspective, which can guide it to build higher quality and more liveable estates. he explains: “the information from these studies help us determine how best we can preserve existing biodiversity and mitigate the impact of the developments on the environment.” for example, hdb incorporated green corridors – continuous green passages – in punggol northshore to maintain its ecological balance and promote biodiversity. new habitats such as dragonfly ponds, bird sanctuaries and butterfly gardens are introduced along the green corridors to attract diverse species. in the future, those who live in the tengah hdb town can immerse themselves in greenery in many ways too. they can hike in a forest corridor that stretches about 5km long and 100m wide, relax with friends and family in a central park with ponds and canals, and try their hand at gardening and urban farming in community farmways. in woodlands north, where hdb will develop more public housing, an environmental study found an area spanning over four hectares, the equivalent of about six football fields, worthy of conservation due to its rare and native plants, and freshwater stream. “with this knowledge, we could decisively adjust our plans,” says dr chong. where necessary, the authority also engages a specialist to come up with an environmental management and monitoring plan to curb any potential environmental impact from infrastructure works. this could include guiding wildlife away from the site to nearby forests before starting the development. he notes: “with this science-based approach, we ensure that we take singapore’s limited resources into consideration. then, we can make trade-off decisions in the most informed manner for projects across a wide variety of land-use needs.” listening and learning more more recently, hdb, together with other government agencies, has stepped up conversations with communities and people who are passionate about singapore’s natural and built heritage, including residents, nature enthusiasts and heritage groups, to listen to their feedback on its plans. for instance, it used the findings from the environmental baseline study, as well as subsequent feedback from nature groups and the public, to revise the urban planning and design strategies for ulu pandan, taking a holistic and science-based approach to balance development and nature conservation. the revised conceptual plans also took into consideration the findings from nparks’ ecological profiling exercise (epe). considering the feedback and its comparatively richer biodiversity, a decision was made to retain the western half of ulu pandan as is in the medium term. the plans for the area will be reviewed sometime around 2030, taking into consideration singapore’s land use needs at that time. in the meantime, a nature park within this part of the site, will be safeguarded to serve as a natural habitat and ecological corridor between clementi forest and the southern ridges. “this park will also complement the connectivity along the rail corridor in the vicinity of ulu pandan, which is one of two ecological corridors identified in nparks’ epe. we are proposing other green features, such as about five hectares of greenery on the eastern side of the site and along ulu pandan canal for park and recreational use, and a linear park along the canal too,” dr chong elaborates. building for the future ultimately, one of hdb’s key goals is to integrate natural elements into its development plans, and its developments into their green surroundings. “at the macro level, we try to preserve pockets of space where we can. we also go down to the micro level to look at things like how to protect trees and species we know are important,” he says. with these efforts, singapore could become greener as it grows denser. for residents like mr firdaus and his family, the proof is in the verdant greenery all around them. in bidadari, which was built with the vision of “a community in a garden”, the bidadari park alone occupies 10 ha, more than a tenth of the estate’s land area, and is home to more than 350 conserved mature trees and 2,000 new trees that include critically endangered varieties. nestled seamlessly within the site’s lush and hilly landscape, it is also a sanctuary for wildlife, with its shrubs, trees, flowering plants and connections to other nature ways facilitating their movement around the park and to other parts of singapore. dr chong shares: “the world has become more environmentally conscious, more in tune with the built environment’s impact on flora and fauna. when we talk about sustainability, it’s thinking about how to better preserve the natural heritage that has been given to us, and making sure that future generations can enjoy the environment we grew up in.” find out how hdb plans and

       "      <td>The PAP town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>the pap town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. dr teo ho pin, the coordinating chairman of pap town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the pap-owned action information management (aim). \"the vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. it would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. he added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. dr teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. apart from aim, there was csc technologies services, hutcabb consulting, ncs, and nec asia. in the end, only aim submitted a bid. said dr teo: \"i am aware that ncs considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the ip rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with ncs would not come with a rate increase. dr teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. workers' party chairman sylvia lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. he said: \"under the contract with aim, the tcs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the tcs were not satisfied with aim's performance. similarly, aim could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a tc, or to the scope and duties of a tc, like changes to its boundaries. \"this is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing tc- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a tc which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on friday by ms lim, who is also chairman of the aljunied-hougang town council. ms lim, dr teo and mr chandra das of aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-december when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. on friday, ms lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between pap town councils and aim. that night, dr teo said he would go through ms lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". he ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"we entered into the transaction with aim with the objective of benefitting the tcs. over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. there is thus no basis to suggest that the aim transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the tcs.\"</td>\n",

After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - MPs debated what constitutes basic needs in Parliament on Wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) Report 2023 by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) had drawn a joint response from the Government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) made in an adjournment motion on Wednesday. There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>singapore - enshrining flexible work arrangements (fwas) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals workers’ party mp louis chua (sengkang grc) made in an adjournment motion on wednesday. there is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer fwas, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said mr chua. “we cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “we need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the tfr (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to singapore.” he highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. he cited the record-low tfr of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. mr chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. he also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. a 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up fwas or not, he added. “this would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up fwas to take up caregiving responsibilities.” for persons with disabilities (pwds), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of pwds who are not working to do so, he said. he cited jurisdictions such as britain, australia, the philippines and thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request fwas, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under fwas. “even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. responding to mr chua on wednesday, minister of state for education and manpower gan siow huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of fwas can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. she said a broader view of fwas could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. for fwas to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, ms gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “the key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. there’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” ms gan noted that fwas, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. turning fwas into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. she added: “flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “it is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” she stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. ms gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request fwas, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. the tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated.

       "      <td>singapore – seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. last friday, state coroner adam nakhoda ruled that mr yap ee guan’s death on july 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the workplace safety and health council following the accident. these included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. according to the coroner’s report, mr yap was working for takenaka corp. since july 1, 2022, he had been deployed to a worksite in pasir ris industrial drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. takenaka had contracted bbr piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. on july 6, 2022, mr yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. as part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. after the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “i found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said state coroner nakhoda. the fragment hit mr yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. the 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. he was taken by ambulance to changi general hospital, where he underwent surgery. he suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. his family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. a decision was made to take him off life support. mr yap died on july 13, 2022. the coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. but he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. the coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in bbr’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  however, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. the coroner said he accepted the ministry of manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. the coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. he said: “shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. if such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “a pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"   \n",

                                                  A salesman was jailed on Wednesday for a month for punching the 20-year-old boyfriend of an 18-year-old student he knew. Leang Shi Ming, 24, had sent her a text message at 3am on June 16 last year asking her if she was free to talk. Mr Edwin Poo Wei Lun, who was sleeping over at the student's Punggol flat, replied the text and told Leang to leave her alone as she was very young. After a flurry of text messages between the two men, they met at the void deck at 4.45am where Leang punched Mr Poo, causing fractures near his eyes.   \n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.   \n",

               In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5466  SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",



councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. dr teo ho pin, the coordinating chairman of pap town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the pap-owned action information management (aim). \"the vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. it would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. he added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. dr teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. apart from aim, there was csc technologies services, hutcabb consulting, ncs, and nec asia. in the end, only aim submitted a bid. said dr teo: \"i am aware that ncs considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the ip rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with ncs would not come with a rate increase. dr teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. workers' party chairman sylvia lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. he said: \"under the contract with aim, the tcs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the tcs were not satisfied with aim's performance. similarly, aim could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a tc, or to the scope and duties of a tc, like changes to its boundaries. \"this is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing tc- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a tc which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on friday by ms lim, who is also chairman of the aljunied-hougang town council. ms lim, dr teo and mr chandra das of aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-december when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. on friday, ms lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between pap town councils and aim. that night, dr teo said he would go through ms lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". he ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"we entered into the transaction with aim with the objective of benefitting the tcs. over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. there is thus no basis to suggest that the aim transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the tcs.\"   \n",

                                    a truck driver who failed to help a severely injured pedestrian he had hit was sentenced to six weeks' jail and banned from driving on wednesday. shann menon alias sanjay menon sudhamodaren menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of mr ng chiew wan, 78, along ang mo kio avenue 4 at 8.12pm on jan 24, 2010. he was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, mr silvaraj arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. he had failed to see mr ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to mr silvaraj, a forklift driver. the jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. mr ng died of his injuries two days later. the court heard that menon was driving with mr silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit mr ng. after impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. mr silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. he went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. before the accident, the four had been drinking at kim keat and shared a bottle of whisky.

               in april, us$2.7 million (s$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of ms joaquina rodrigues at the crown bank in the united states by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. these monies were transferred to bank accounts in singapore, hong kong and dubai. the singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. a district court heard that stephen lim ee tak, 46, befriended ms julie hasler, an australian, through a dating website last march. lim, who was unemployed then, said hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in malaysia. ms rodrigues reported her missing funds to the federal bureau of investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. on may 8 last year, police officers raided lim's punggol home and arrested him. he admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

mps debated what constitutes basic needs in parliament on wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  the minimum income standards (mis) report 2023 by nanyang technological university (ntu) and the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) had drawn a joint response from the government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. on wednesday, mr ang wei neng (west coast grc) asked whether the ministry of social and family development (msf) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the mis report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. in response, senior parliamentary secretary for social and family development eric chua said msf regularly reviews comcare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. he said the ministry last increased the cash support for comcare short-to-medium term assistance and long-term assistance in august 2022. mr chua added that msf references price data from the department of statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by msf in reviewing the assistance schemes. mr ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the mis report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. in response, mr chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. he added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. mr chua said the mis study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. he noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. workers’ party mp jamus lim (sengkang grc) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. associate professor lim also cited how mr chua had said in parliament on tuesday that comcare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. in response, mr chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. he added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, mr chua told the house. “let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. leader of the opposition pritam singh (aljunied grc) asked if msf would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. mr chua said msf officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

enshrining flexible work arrangements (fwas) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals workers’ party mp louis chua (sengkang grc) made in an adjournment motion on wednesday. there is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer fwas, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said mr chua. “we cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “we need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the tfr (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to singapore.” he highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. he cited the record-low tfr of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. mr chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. he also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. a 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up fwas or not, he added. “this would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up fwas to take up caregiving responsibilities.” for persons with disabilities (pwds), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of pwds who are not working to do so, he said. he cited jurisdictions such as britain, australia, the philippines and thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request fwas, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under fwas. “even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. responding to mr chua on wednesday, minister of state for education and manpower gan siow huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of fwas can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. she said a broader view of fwas could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. for fwas to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, ms gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “the key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. there’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” ms gan noted that fwas, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. turning fwas into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. she added: “flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “it is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” she stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. ms gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request fwas, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. the tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5466  singapore – a $2.6 billion programme to renew the north-south and east-west mrt lines is slated to be mostly completed by december. four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. new concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. the third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a committee of inquiry being convened. the new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. the glitchy power system had also caused singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the north-south, east-west lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of july 7. the new power system – completed in september 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. this is due to be completed by december. track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. the rest will be rolled out by 2026. when everything is in place, mrt users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. for instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. but even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (mkbf) since 2019, compared with 70,000 mkbf and 60,000 mkbf on the north-south and east-west lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. mkbf – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. acting transport minister chee hong tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at bishan depot on wednesday morning. he mentioned mr krishnasamy kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with smrt since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “he reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” mr chee said. the power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “the total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. land transport authority (lta) senior project manager mohamad ridhwan abdul lazim was also mentioned. his team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “one of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” mr chee noted. ms wang yizhen, an engineer from the lta’s rolling stock team, went to china during “the height of covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “they must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to china, and quite possibly many rounds of pcr (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” mr chee said, adding that ms wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. programme manager eugene mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “the upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. but it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” ms carrie shum, a 28-year-old hong konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in hong kong. “i am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. author jimmy chua, 39, said: “it is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. and a new power system that may prevent downtimes. and there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “i think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” engineer ng guan hong, 53, said: “replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the mrt maintenance programme. what i look forward to more is how the lta can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” completion of six core systems and cost: replacement of rail wooden sleepers: completed in december 2016 replacement of third rail: completed in september 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) upgrading of train signalling system: completed in 2018, $195 million replacement of power system: completed in september 2023, $500 million replacement of track circuit system: to be completed in december 2023, $73 million replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

                        singapore – four luxury cars linked to singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (gcb) in third avenue, off bukit timah road, on wednesday. at around 2.30pm, a red rolls-royce dawn, a black rolls-royce cullinan, a red porsche 911 targa and a white toyota alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. the cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in september by a commercial affairs department (cad) officer. the gcb was rented by vanuatu national su jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. the straits times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. at least eight police officers were at the property. the first to be towed out was the cullinan, followed by the dawn, the alphard, and then the targa. each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. st followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near pioneer road, where all four cars were parked. there were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue rolls-royce. on wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. four cars and 56 bearbrick ornaments were seized. the police did not say where the other location was. a bearbrick – stylised as be@rbrick – is a collectible toy figure produced by japanese collectible company medicom toy. the toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. mr shawn wee, the owner of collectibles store eye for toys, had told st in august that the bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. the police said: “as part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” the cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. this means they cannot be sold. the vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. the case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. the police had said in august that su was arrested at his residence in third avenue. he faces four money laundering charges. on oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. in fact, investigations show that this firm, an xing technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. the cad officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. they include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. according to an accounting and corporate regulatory authority search, su has another registered address at a st thomas walk condominium. he is wanted in china for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. another of the accused, cypriot national wang dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. this is the second time this week that st has seen items being moved out from gcbs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. on monday at around 2pm, st saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a gcb in nassim road. the pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. su baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the gcb in nassim road with his wife ma ning. there were several cars parked on the street during the operation. st also saw plain-clothes police officers there. last wednesday, st saw items being removed from another gcb in bishopsgate, off tanglin road, by movers. the house is rented by another accused – vang shuiming, or wang shuiming – and his wife wang ruiyan. vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. the items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of macallan 25 years sherry oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. the truck, which was escorted by the same car present in nassim road on monday, then travelled to le freeport singapore, a high-security storage facility in changi north crescent. it is touted as the safest area in singapore for wealth protection. shin min daily news had reported last friday that a number of other assets, including a rolls-royce and a bentley, were also transported from the bishopsgate house. plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. an anti-money laundering operation on aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as tanglin, bukit timah, orchard road, sentosa and river valley. ten foreigners, all originally from china, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                    singapore – seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. last friday, state coroner adam nakhoda ruled that mr yap ee guan’s death on july 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the workplace safety and health council following the accident. these included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. according to the coroner’s report, mr yap was working for takenaka corp. since july 1, 2022, he had been deployed to a worksite in pasir ris industrial drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. takenaka had contracted bbr piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. on july 6, 2022, mr yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. as part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. after the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “i found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said state coroner nakhoda. the fragment hit mr yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. the 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. he was taken by ambulance to changi general hospital, where he underwent surgery. he suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. his family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. a decision was made to take him off life support. mr yap died on july 13, 2022. the coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. but he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. the coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in bbr’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  however, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. the coroner said he accepted the ministry of manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. the coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. he said: “shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. if such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “a pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>The PAP town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"</td>\n",

The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - MPs debated what constitutes basic needs in Parliament on Wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) Report 2023 by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) had drawn a joint response from the Government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) made in an adjournment motion on Wednesday. There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived.

       "      <td>singapore – a $2.6 billion programme to renew the north-south and east-west mrt lines is slated to be mostly completed by december. four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. new concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. the third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a committee of inquiry being convened. the new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. the glitchy power system had also caused singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the north-south, east-west lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of july 7. the new power system – completed in september 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. this is due to be completed by december. track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. the rest will be rolled out by 2026. when everything is in place, mrt users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. for instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. but even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (mkbf) since 2019, compared with 70,000 mkbf and 60,000 mkbf on the north-south and east-west lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. mkbf – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. acting transport minister chee hong tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at bishan depot on wednesday morning. he mentioned mr krishnasamy kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with smrt since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “he reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” mr chee said. the power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “the total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. land transport authority (lta) senior project manager mohamad ridhwan abdul lazim was also mentioned. his team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “one of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” mr chee noted. ms wang yizhen, an

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"   \n",

                                                  A salesman was jailed on Wednesday for a month for punching the 20-year-old boyfriend of an 18-year-old student he knew. Leang Shi Ming, 24, had sent her a text message at 3am on June 16 last year asking her if she was free to talk. Mr Edwin Poo Wei Lun, who was sleeping over at the student's Punggol flat, replied the text and told Leang to leave her alone as she was very young. After a flurry of text messages between the two men, they met at the void deck at 4.45am where Leang punched Mr Poo, causing fractures near his eyes.   \n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.   \n",

               In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5466  SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",



councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. dr teo ho pin, the coordinating chairman of pap town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the pap-owned action information management (aim). \"the vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. it would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. he added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. dr teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. apart from aim, there was csc technologies services, hutcabb consulting, ncs, and nec asia. in the end, only aim submitted a bid. said dr teo: \"i am aware that ncs considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the ip rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with ncs would not come with a rate increase. dr teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. workers' party chairman sylvia lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. he said: \"under the contract with aim, the tcs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the tcs were not satisfied with aim's performance. similarly, aim could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a tc, or to the scope and duties of a tc, like changes to its boundaries. \"this is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing tc- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a tc which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on friday by ms lim, who is also chairman of the aljunied-hougang town council. ms lim, dr teo and mr chandra das of aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-december when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. on friday, ms lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between pap town councils and aim. that night, dr teo said he would go through ms lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". he ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"we entered into the transaction with aim with the objective of benefitting the tcs. over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. there is thus no basis to suggest that the aim transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the tcs.\"   \n",

                                    a truck driver who failed to help a severely injured pedestrian he had hit was sentenced to six weeks' jail and banned from driving on wednesday. shann menon alias sanjay menon sudhamodaren menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of mr ng chiew wan, 78, along ang mo kio avenue 4 at 8.12pm on jan 24, 2010. he was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, mr silvaraj arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. he had failed to see mr ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to mr silvaraj, a forklift driver. the jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. mr ng died of his injuries two days later. the court heard that menon was driving with mr silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit mr ng. after impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. mr silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. he went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. before the accident, the four had been drinking at kim keat and shared a bottle of whisky.

               in april, us$2.7 million (s$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of ms joaquina rodrigues at the crown bank in the united states by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. these monies were transferred to bank accounts in singapore, hong kong and dubai. the singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. a district court heard that stephen lim ee tak, 46, befriended ms julie hasler, an australian, through a dating website last march. lim, who was unemployed then, said hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in malaysia. ms rodrigues reported her missing funds to the federal bureau of investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. on may 8 last year, police officers raided lim's punggol home and arrested him. he admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

mps debated what constitutes basic needs in parliament on wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  the minimum income standards (mis) report 2023 by nanyang technological university (ntu) and the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) had drawn a joint response from the government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. on wednesday, mr ang wei neng (west coast grc) asked whether the ministry of social and family development (msf) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the mis report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. in response, senior parliamentary secretary for social and family development eric chua said msf regularly reviews comcare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. he said the ministry last increased the cash support for comcare short-to-medium term assistance and long-term assistance in august 2022. mr chua added that msf references price data from the department of statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by msf in reviewing the assistance schemes. mr ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the mis report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. in response, mr chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. he added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. mr chua said the mis study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. he noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. workers’ party mp jamus lim (sengkang grc) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. associate professor lim also cited how mr chua had said in parliament on tuesday that comcare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. in response, mr chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. he added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, mr chua told the house. “let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. leader of the opposition pritam singh (aljunied grc) asked if msf would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. mr chua said msf officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

enshrining flexible work arrangements (fwas) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals workers’ party mp louis chua (sengkang grc) made in an adjournment motion on wednesday. there is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer fwas, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said mr chua. “we cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “we need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the tfr (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to singapore.” he highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. he cited the record-low tfr of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. mr chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. he also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. a 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up fwas or not, he added. “this would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up fwas to take up caregiving responsibilities.” for persons with disabilities (pwds), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of pwds who are not working to do so, he said. he cited jurisdictions such as britain, australia, the philippines and thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request fwas, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under fwas. “even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. responding to mr chua on wednesday, minister of state for education and manpower gan siow huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of fwas can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. she said a broader view of fwas could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. for fwas to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, ms gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “the key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. there’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” ms gan noted that fwas, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. turning fwas into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. she added: “flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “it is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” she stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. ms gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request fwas, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. the tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5466  singapore – a $2.6 billion programme to renew the north-south and east-west mrt lines is slated to be mostly completed by december. four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. new concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. the third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a committee of inquiry being convened. the new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. the glitchy power system had also caused singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the north-south, east-west lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of july 7. the new power system – completed in september 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. this is due to be completed by december. track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. the rest will be rolled out by 2026. when everything is in place, mrt users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. for instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. but even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (mkbf) since 2019, compared with 70,000 mkbf and 60,000 mkbf on the north-south and east-west lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. mkbf – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. acting transport minister chee hong tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at bishan depot on wednesday morning. he mentioned mr krishnasamy kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with smrt since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “he reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” mr chee said. the power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “the total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. land transport authority (lta) senior project manager mohamad ridhwan abdul lazim was also mentioned. his team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “one of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” mr chee noted. ms wang yizhen, an engineer from the lta’s rolling stock team, went to china during “the height of covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “they must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to china, and quite possibly many rounds of pcr (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” mr chee said, adding that ms wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. programme manager eugene mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “the upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. but it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” ms carrie shum, a 28-year-old hong konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in hong kong. “i am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. author jimmy chua, 39, said: “it is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. and a new power system that may prevent downtimes. and there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “i think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” engineer ng guan hong, 53, said: “replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the mrt maintenance programme. what i look forward to more is how the lta can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” completion of six core systems and cost: replacement of rail wooden sleepers: completed in december 2016 replacement of third rail: completed in september 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) upgrading of train signalling system: completed in 2018, $195 million replacement of power system: completed in september 2023, $500 million replacement of track circuit system: to be completed in december 2023, $73 million replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

                        singapore – four luxury cars linked to singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (gcb) in third avenue, off bukit timah road, on wednesday. at around 2.30pm, a red rolls-royce dawn, a black rolls-royce cullinan, a red porsche 911 targa and a white toyota alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. the cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in september by a commercial affairs department (cad) officer. the gcb was rented by vanuatu national su jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. the straits times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. at least eight police officers were at the property. the first to be towed out was the cullinan, followed by the dawn, the alphard, and then the targa. each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. st followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near pioneer road, where all four cars were parked. there were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue rolls-royce. on wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. four cars and 56 bearbrick ornaments were seized. the police did not say where the other location was. a bearbrick – stylised as be@rbrick – is a collectible toy figure produced by japanese collectible company medicom toy. the toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. mr shawn wee, the owner of collectibles store eye for toys, had told st in august that the bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. the police said: “as part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” the cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. this means they cannot be sold. the vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. the case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. the police had said in august that su was arrested at his residence in third avenue. he faces four money laundering charges. on oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. in fact, investigations show that this firm, an xing technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. the cad officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. they include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. according to an accounting and corporate regulatory authority search, su has another registered address at a st thomas walk condominium. he is wanted in china for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. another of the accused, cypriot national wang dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. this is the second time this week that st has seen items being moved out from gcbs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. on monday at around 2pm, st saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a gcb in nassim road. the pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. su baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the gcb in nassim road with his wife ma ning. there were several cars parked on the street during the operation. st also saw plain-clothes police officers there. last wednesday, st saw items being removed from another gcb in bishopsgate, off tanglin road, by movers. the house is rented by another accused – vang shuiming, or wang shuiming – and his wife wang ruiyan. vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. the items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of macallan 25 years sherry oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. the truck, which was escorted by the same car present in nassim road on monday, then travelled to le freeport singapore, a high-security storage facility in changi north crescent. it is touted as the safest area in singapore for wealth protection. shin min daily news had reported last friday that a number of other assets, including a rolls-royce and a bentley, were also transported from the bishopsgate house. plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. an anti-money laundering operation on aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as tanglin, bukit timah, orchard road, sentosa and river valley. ten foreigners, all originally from china, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                    singapore – seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. last friday, state coroner adam nakhoda ruled that mr yap ee guan’s death on july 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the workplace safety and health council following the accident. these included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. according to the coroner’s report, mr yap was working for takenaka corp. since july 1, 2022, he had been deployed to a worksite in pasir ris industrial drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. takenaka had contracted bbr piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. on july 6, 2022, mr yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. as part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. after the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “i found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said state coroner nakhoda. the fragment hit mr yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. the 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. he was taken by ambulance to changi general hospital, where he underwent surgery. he suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. his family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. a decision was made to take him off life support. mr yap died on july 13, 2022. the coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. but he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. the coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in bbr’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  however, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. the coroner said he accepted the ministry of manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. the coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. he said: “shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. if such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “a pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>The PAP town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"</td>\n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - MPs debated what constitutes basic needs in Parliament on Wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) Report 2023 by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) had drawn a joint response from the Government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) made in an adjournment motion on Wednesday. There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived.

       "      <td>singapore – a $2.6 billion programme to renew the north-south and east-west mrt lines is slated to be mostly completed by december. four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. new concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. the third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a committee of inquiry being convened. the new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. the glitchy power system had also caused singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the north-south, east-west lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of july 7. the new power system – completed in september 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. this is due to be completed by december. track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. the rest will be rolled out by 2026. when everything is in place, mrt users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. for instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. but even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (mkbf) since 2019, compared with 70,000 mkbf and 60,000 mkbf on the north-south and east-west lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. mkbf – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. acting transport minister chee hong tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at bishan depot on wednesday morning. he mentioned mr krishnasamy kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with smrt since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “he reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” mr chee said. the power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “the total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"   \n",

                                                  A salesman was jailed on Wednesday for a month for punching the 20-year-old boyfriend of an 18-year-old student he knew. Leang Shi Ming, 24, had sent her a text message at 3am on June 16 last year asking her if she was free to talk. Mr Edwin Poo Wei Lun, who was sleeping over at the student's Punggol flat, replied the text and told Leang to leave her alone as she was very young. After a flurry of text messages between the two men, they met at the void deck at 4.45am where Leang punched Mr Poo, causing fractures near his eyes.   \n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.   \n",

               In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5466  SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",



councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. dr teo ho pin, the coordinating chairman of pap town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the pap-owned action information management (aim). \"the vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. it would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. he added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. dr teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. apart from aim, there was csc technologies services, hutcabb consulting, ncs, and nec asia. in the end, only aim submitted a bid. said dr teo: \"i am aware that ncs considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the ip rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with ncs would not come with a rate increase. dr teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. workers' party chairman sylvia lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. he said: \"under the contract with aim, the tcs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the tcs were not satisfied with aim's performance. similarly, aim could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a tc, or to the scope and duties of a tc, like changes to its boundaries. \"this is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing tc- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a tc which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on friday by ms lim, who is also chairman of the aljunied-hougang town council. ms lim, dr teo and mr chandra das of aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-december when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. on friday, ms lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between pap town councils and aim. that night, dr teo said he would go through ms lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". he ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"we entered into the transaction with aim with the objective of benefitting the tcs. over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. there is thus no basis to suggest that the aim transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the tcs.\"   \n",

                                    a truck driver who failed to help a severely injured pedestrian he had hit was sentenced to six weeks' jail and banned from driving on wednesday. shann menon alias sanjay menon sudhamodaren menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of mr ng chiew wan, 78, along ang mo kio avenue 4 at 8.12pm on jan 24, 2010. he was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, mr silvaraj arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. he had failed to see mr ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to mr silvaraj, a forklift driver. the jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. mr ng died of his injuries two days later. the court heard that menon was driving with mr silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit mr ng. after impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. mr silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. he went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. before the accident, the four had been drinking at kim keat and shared a bottle of whisky.

               in april, us$2.7 million (s$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of ms joaquina rodrigues at the crown bank in the united states by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. these monies were transferred to bank accounts in singapore, hong kong and dubai. the singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. a district court heard that stephen lim ee tak, 46, befriended ms julie hasler, an australian, through a dating website last march. lim, who was unemployed then, said hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in malaysia. ms rodrigues reported her missing funds to the federal bureau of investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. on may 8 last year, police officers raided lim's punggol home and arrested him. he admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

mps debated what constitutes basic needs in parliament on wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  the minimum income standards (mis) report 2023 by nanyang technological university (ntu) and the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) had drawn a joint response from the government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. on wednesday, mr ang wei neng (west coast grc) asked whether the ministry of social and family development (msf) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the mis report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. in response, senior parliamentary secretary for social and family development eric chua said msf regularly reviews comcare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. he said the ministry last increased the cash support for comcare short-to-medium term assistance and long-term assistance in august 2022. mr chua added that msf references price data from the department of statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by msf in reviewing the assistance schemes. mr ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the mis report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. in response, mr chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. he added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. mr chua said the mis study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. he noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. workers’ party mp jamus lim (sengkang grc) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. associate professor lim also cited how mr chua had said in parliament on tuesday that comcare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. in response, mr chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. he added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, mr chua told the house. “let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. leader of the opposition pritam singh (aljunied grc) asked if msf would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. mr chua said msf officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

enshrining flexible work arrangements (fwas) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals workers’ party mp louis chua (sengkang grc) made in an adjournment motion on wednesday. there is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer fwas, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said mr chua. “we cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “we need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the tfr (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to singapore.” he highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. he cited the record-low tfr of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. mr chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. he also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. a 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up fwas or not, he added. “this would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up fwas to take up caregiving responsibilities.” for persons with disabilities (pwds), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of pwds who are not working to do so, he said. he cited jurisdictions such as britain, australia, the philippines and thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request fwas, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under fwas. “even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. responding to mr chua on wednesday, minister of state for education and manpower gan siow huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of fwas can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. she said a broader view of fwas could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. for fwas to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, ms gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “the key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. there’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” ms gan noted that fwas, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. turning fwas into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. she added: “flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “it is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” she stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. ms gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request fwas, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. the tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5466  singapore – a $2.6 billion programme to renew the north-south and east-west mrt lines is slated to be mostly completed by december. four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. new concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. the third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a committee of inquiry being convened. the new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. the glitchy power system had also caused singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the north-south, east-west lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of july 7. the new power system – completed in september 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. this is due to be completed by december. track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. the rest will be rolled out by 2026. when everything is in place, mrt users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. for instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. but even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (mkbf) since 2019, compared with 70,000 mkbf and 60,000 mkbf on the north-south and east-west lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. mkbf – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. acting transport minister chee hong tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at bishan depot on wednesday morning. he mentioned mr krishnasamy kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with smrt since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “he reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” mr chee said. the power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “the total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. land transport authority (lta) senior project manager mohamad ridhwan abdul lazim was also mentioned. his team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “one of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” mr chee noted. ms wang yizhen, an engineer from the lta’s rolling stock team, went to china during “the height of covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “they must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to china, and quite possibly many rounds of pcr (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” mr chee said, adding that ms wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. programme manager eugene mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “the upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. but it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” ms carrie shum, a 28-year-old hong konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in hong kong. “i am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. author jimmy chua, 39, said: “it is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. and a new power system that may prevent downtimes. and there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “i think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” engineer ng guan hong, 53, said: “replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the mrt maintenance programme. what i look forward to more is how the lta can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” completion of six core systems and cost: replacement of rail wooden sleepers: completed in december 2016 replacement of third rail: completed in september 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) upgrading of train signalling system: completed in 2018, $195 million replacement of power system: completed in september 2023, $500 million replacement of track circuit system: to be completed in december 2023, $73 million replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

                        singapore – four luxury cars linked to singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (gcb) in third avenue, off bukit timah road, on wednesday. at around 2.30pm, a red rolls-royce dawn, a black rolls-royce cullinan, a red porsche 911 targa and a white toyota alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. the cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in september by a commercial affairs department (cad) officer. the gcb was rented by vanuatu national su jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. the straits times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. at least eight police officers were at the property. the first to be towed out was the cullinan, followed by the dawn, the alphard, and then the targa. each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. st followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near pioneer road, where all four cars were parked. there were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue rolls-royce. on wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. four cars and 56 bearbrick ornaments were seized. the police did not say where the other location was. a bearbrick – stylised as be@rbrick – is a collectible toy figure produced by japanese collectible company medicom toy. the toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. mr shawn wee, the owner of collectibles store eye for toys, had told st in august that the bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. the police said: “as part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” the cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. this means they cannot be sold. the vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. the case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. the police had said in august that su was arrested at his residence in third avenue. he faces four money laundering charges. on oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. in fact, investigations show that this firm, an xing technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. the cad officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. they include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. according to an accounting and corporate regulatory authority search, su has another registered address at a st thomas walk condominium. he is wanted in china for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. another of the accused, cypriot national wang dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. this is the second time this week that st has seen items being moved out from gcbs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. on monday at around 2pm, st saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a gcb in nassim road. the pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. su baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the gcb in nassim road with his wife ma ning. there were several cars parked on the street during the operation. st also saw plain-clothes police officers there. last wednesday, st saw items being removed from another gcb in bishopsgate, off tanglin road, by movers. the house is rented by another accused – vang shuiming, or wang shuiming – and his wife wang ruiyan. vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. the items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of macallan 25 years sherry oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. the truck, which was escorted by the same car present in nassim road on monday, then travelled to le freeport singapore, a high-security storage facility in changi north crescent. it is touted as the safest area in singapore for wealth protection. shin min daily news had reported last friday that a number of other assets, including a rolls-royce and a bentley, were also transported from the bishopsgate house. plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. an anti-money laundering operation on aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as tanglin, bukit timah, orchard road, sentosa and river valley. ten foreigners, all originally from china, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                    singapore – seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. last friday, state coroner adam nakhoda ruled that mr yap ee guan’s death on july 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the workplace safety and health council following the accident. these included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. according to the coroner’s report, mr yap was working for takenaka corp. since july 1, 2022, he had been deployed to a worksite in pasir ris industrial drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. takenaka had contracted bbr piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. on july 6, 2022, mr yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. as part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. after the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “i found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said state coroner nakhoda. the fragment hit mr yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. the 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. he was taken by ambulance to changi general hospital, where he underwent surgery. he suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. his family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. a decision was made to take him off life support. mr yap died on july 13, 2022. the coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. but he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. the coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in bbr’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  however, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. the coroner said he accepted the ministry of manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. the coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. he said: “shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. if such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “a pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>The PAP town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>A truck driver who failed to help a severely injured pedestrian he had hit was sentenced to six weeks' jail and banned from driving on Wednesday. Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - MPs debated what constitutes basic needs in Parliament on Wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) Report 2023 by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) had drawn a joint response from the Government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) made in an adjournment motion on Wednesday. There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"   \n",

                                                  A salesman was jailed on Wednesday for a month for punching the 20-year-old boyfriend of an 18-year-old student he knew. Leang Shi Ming, 24, had sent her a text message at 3am on June 16 last year asking her if she was free to talk. Mr Edwin Poo Wei Lun, who was sleeping over at the student's Punggol flat, replied the text and told Leang to leave her alone as she was very young. After a flurry of text messages between the two men, they met at the void deck at 4.45am where Leang punched Mr Poo, causing fractures near his eyes.   \n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.   \n",

               In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5458  SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>The PAP town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"</td>\n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - MPs debated what constitutes basic needs in Parliament on Wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) Report 2023 by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) had drawn a joint response from the Government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) made in an adjournment motion on Wednesday. There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"   \n",

                                                  A salesman was jailed on Wednesday for a month for punching the 20-year-old boyfriend of an 18-year-old student he knew. Leang Shi Ming, 24, had sent her a text message at 3am on June 16 last year asking her if she was free to talk. Mr Edwin Poo Wei Lun, who was sleeping over at the student's Punggol flat, replied the text and told Leang to leave her alone as she was very young. After a flurry of text messages between the two men, they met at the void deck at 4.45am where Leang punched Mr Poo, causing fractures near his eyes.   \n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.   \n",

               In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5458  SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme.

At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",

       "      <td>The PAP town councils sold the management software to a third party because it was \"cumbersome and inefficient\" to have 14 individual town councils hold intellectual property rights to the software. Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"</td>\n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.</td>\n",

Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - MPs debated what constitutes basic needs in Parliament on Wednesday in the wake of a study on adequate minimum incomes published last month.  The Minimum Income Standards (MIS) Report 2023 by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) had drawn a joint response from the Government, which said the study is not just about basic needs such as housing, food and clothing, but what individuals would like to have. On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - Enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law and giving all workers the right to such arrangements were some of the proposals Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) made in an adjournment motion on Wednesday. There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Four luxury cars linked to Singapore’s worst money laundering case were towed out of a good class bungalow (GCB) in Third Avenue, off Bukit Timah Road, on Wednesday. At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SINGAPORE – Seven days after being hit by a fragment of plywood that was flung 26m during a pile-driving analysis test, an assistant construction manager died in hospital. Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”</td>\n",

Dr Teo Ho Pin, the coordinating chairman of PAP town councils, gave this explanation in a 26-paragraph, four-page statement outlining why and how the town councils came to have a sale and lease back deal with the PAP-owned Action Information Management (Aim). \"The vendor would have to deal with all the 14 town councils when reviewing or revising the system. It would be better for the 14 town councils to consolidate their software rights in a single party which would manage them on behalf of all the town councils, and also source vendors to improve the system and address the deficiencies,\" he said. He added that the idea to have a third party own the computer system with the councils paying a service fee was not uncommon and that the deal ultimately yielded savings of around $8,000 for the town councils. Dr Teo went on to name the five companies that collected tender documents. Apart from Aim, there was CSC Technologies Services, Hutcabb Consulting, NCS, and NEC Asia. In the end, only Aim submitted a bid. Said Dr Teo: \"I am aware that NCS considered bidding but in the end, decided not to do so as it was of the view that the IP rights to software developed in 2003 on soon to be replaced platforms were not valuable at all.\" Another withdrew, he said, because it did not want to fulfil a requirement that it ensure the renewal of the contract with NCS would not come with a rate increase. Dr Teo also gave an explanation of a clause stating that the contract with Aim can be terminated if there is a material change in the town council. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim had questioned twice how this clause was in the public interest. He said: \"Under the contract with AIM, the TCs (town councils) could terminate the arrangements by giving one month's notice if the TCs were not satisfied with AIM's performance. Similarly, AIM could terminate by giving one month's notice in the event of material changes to the membership of a TC, or to the scope and duties of a TC, like changes to its boundaries. \"This is reasonable as the contractor has agreed to provide services on the basis of the existing TC- and town-boundaries, and priced this assumption into the tender. Should this change materially, the contractor could end up providing services to a TC which comprises a much larger area and more residents, but at the same price.\" Wednesday's statement comes in response to one issued on Friday by Ms Lim, who is also chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council. Ms Lim, Dr Teo and Mr Chandra Das of Aims had been engaged in a war of words over the matter ever since mid-December when a report on town councils failed to give a score to the opposition town council for corporate governance. On Friday, Ms Lim had issued a statement asking questions about the circumstances surrounding the deal between PAP town councils and Aim. That night, Dr Teo said he would go through Ms Lim's \"latest allegations\" of conflict of interest and \"deal with them openly, in a further statement over the next few days\". He ended his latest remarks by stressing that the deal was beneficial to the town councils: \"We entered into the transaction with Aim with the objective of benefitting the TCs. Over the last two years, the intended benefits have been realised. There is thus no basis to suggest that the AIM transaction did not serve the public interest, or was disadvantageous to residents in the TCs.\"   \n",

                                                  A salesman was jailed on Wednesday for a month for punching the 20-year-old boyfriend of an 18-year-old student he knew. Leang Shi Ming, 24, had sent her a text message at 3am on June 16 last year asking her if she was free to talk. Mr Edwin Poo Wei Lun, who was sleeping over at the student's Punggol flat, replied the text and told Leang to leave her alone as she was very young. After a flurry of text messages between the two men, they met at the void deck at 4.45am where Leang punched Mr Poo, causing fractures near his eyes.   \n",

Shann Menon alias Sanjay Menon Sudhamodaren Menon, 28, who had pleaded guilty to three charges, was fined $6,000 and banned from driving for five years for negligently causing the death of Mr Ng Chiew Wan, 78, along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 at 8.12pm on Jan 24, 2010. He was fined another $2,000 for causing hurt to the front seat passenger, Mr Silvaraj Arulagan, 34, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger life. He had failed to see Mr Ng who was crossing the road then and in trying to avoid him, lost control of the vehicle, which mounted the centre divider and hit a tree, causing injuries to Mr Silvaraj, a forklift driver. The jail sentence plus a three-year driving ban was imposed on the charge for failing to render aid. Mr Ng died of his injuries two days later. The court heard that Menon was driving with Mr Silvaraj and a couple seated in front of his lorry when he failed to keep a proper lookout and hit Mr Ng. After impact, he lost control of the lorry, swerved towards the right and mounted the centre divider road kerb before hitting a tree. Mr Silvaraj and the woman passenger, who were injured, remained at the scene while Menon and the woman's boyfriend left shortly after the collision before police came. He went home straight and only went to hospital the next day to treat his injuries. Before the accident, the four had been drinking at Kim Keat and shared a bottle of whisky.   \n",

               In April, US$2.7 million (S$3.3 million) was drawn out of the account of Ms Joaquina Rodrigues at the Crown Bank in the United States by fraudsters using forged e-mails and wire transfer authorisation forms. These monies were transferred to bank accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The Singapore connection to this scheme was jailed for 4 1/2 years on Thursday for his role in laundering the $855,000 that was sent here. A district court heard that Stephen Lim Ee Tak, 46, befriended Ms Julie Hasler, an Australian, through a dating website last March. Lim, who was unemployed then, said Hasler had asked him to receive money on her behalf. Then on her instructions, he remitted money to people she said were her friends or business suppliers in Malaysia. Ms Rodrigues reported her missing funds to the Federal Bureau of Investigations and it was discovered that fraudsters had forged her signature to authorise the transfers of money. On May 8 last year, police officers raided Lim's Punggol home and arrested him. He admitted that he suspected that the money coming into his bank account was criminal proceeds and had earned $5,556 for helping the fraudsters.   \n",

On Wednesday, Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) asked whether the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) would consider adjusting financial assistance for low-income families in view of the MIS report’s findings, or conduct its own study to determine the level of living wage required to support a basic standard of living. In response, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said MSF regularly reviews ComCare schemes to ensure lower-income families have enough help to meet their basic living needs. He said the ministry last increased the cash support for ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance and Long-Term Assistance in August 2022. Mr Chua added that MSF references price data from the Department of Statistics, views from domain experts and community stakeholders, and academic studies and research commissioned by MSF in reviewing the assistance schemes. Mr Ang pointed out a “big discrepancy” between the MIS report – which proposed a monthly income of around $1,680 per capita to meet basic needs – and the Government’s response, which pegged the national average monthly expenditure at $1,650 per capita. In response, Mr Chua brought up limitations in the report’s methodology, citing how many of the 300 participants in the small group discussions are not from low-income households, and how those in the minority may find it hard to share their views due to the group dynamics. He added that the study assumes that low-income households get the same amount of financial help as median-income households, which is incorrect. Mr Chua said the MIS study looked beyond the basic needs of lower-income families, which is what government aid schemes provide for. He noted that the report also looked at “what it takes to enable a sense of belonging, respect, security, independence”, which is aspirational and what individuals or families would like to have. Workers’ Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) made the point that items like perfume could constitute a basic need as people may need it to stay presentable in Singapore’s hot climate when they go to work. Associate Professor Lim also cited how Mr Chua had said in Parliament on Tuesday that ComCare has expanded its notion of basic needs to include mobile data plans, for instance. In response, Mr Chua said mobile data plans allows for digital connectivity and human connection, which are basic needs. He added that he had spoken to two lower-income single mothers living in public rental flats on Wednesday morning and asked them what they thought of items such as perfume, jewellery and overseas holidays, and whether they hoped to afford these items. Both said the items were “good to have”, and that they want to work hard and afford the items themselves, Mr Chua told the House. “Let us not underestimate the agency, the strength and the dignity of our low-income families and their ability to turn things around and to break the cycle of poverty,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC) asked if MSF would consider giving a higher payout to full-time caregivers who are unable to work. Mr Chua said MSF officers look at the comprehensive situation of each family and individual before providing the help needed.   \n",

There is currently no legal imperative for employers to offer FWAs, and going beyond non-binding advisories and guidelines with legislation would protect groups of workers such as parents, caregivers and people with disabilities, said Mr Chua. “We cannot expect incremental efforts to result in extraordinary results. “We need to take bold and decisive steps and provide greater financial and non-financial support to Singaporean families, recognising that the stresses on families and the TFR (total fertility rate) crisis of generations, if not urgently addressed today, would have significant long-term socio-economic cost to Singapore.” He highlighted the trend of some employers insisting employees return to the office after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted despite the popularity of flexi-work. He cited the record-low TFR of 1.04 in 2022, with polls showing that 39 per cent of respondents did not want to have a child as it would affect their career and lifestyle. Many respondents also said that job stress and their workload stopped them from having children. Mr Chua added that six days of childcare leave were insufficient to deal with the scheduled closures of some of his residents’ children’s pre-schools. Parents also need time off to care for their children when they fall sick. He also pointed to the burden on caregivers of ageing parents. A 2023 study has found that the average caregiver holds a full-time job, and spends 6.7 hours per day on caregiving, he said. Clear action must be taken to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on their caregiving and family duties, and for workers’ performance to be assessed fairly, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not, he added. “This would play a big role in helping to address fears of workers, particularly women at this point in time, on the downside they may face in taking up FWAs to take up caregiving responsibilities.” For persons with disabilities (PWDs), the right to flexible work arrangements would help to advance their careers while encouraging more of the 65.7 per cent of PWDs who are not working to do so, he said. He cited jurisdictions such as Britain, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand that have passed legislation governing the right to request FWAs, or provide for a legal framework to support the rights of employees under FWAs. “Even if ultimately, the employer decides in a fair and transparent manner that this is simply not possible for various reasons, such circumstances can be addressed through the necessary legislative protections for both employers and especially employees,” he said. Responding to Mr Chua on Wednesday, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang said that while efforts are under way to make flexible arrangements more accessible, not all forms of FWAs can be implemented for every job as the nature of work differs across sectors. She said a broader view of FWAs could be taken to include options such as staggered hours, flexible shifts and part-time work. For FWAs to be sustainable, the impact on individual and team productivity must also be considered, Ms Gan said, adding that international research found that the impact on productivity differs across sectors and job roles. “The key is to make sure that we identify the right forms of flexible work arrangements for different job needs, and ensure that communication between management and employees and within teams remains strong. There’s just no one-size-fits-all approach for this.” Ms Gan noted that FWAs, if implemented well, can help companies retain and attract workers amid a tight labour market. Turning FWAs into something rigid, however, could be detrimental to businesses and even to workers themselves. She added: “Flexible work arrangement on its own is not the silver bullet to achieving the larger goal of work-life harmony. “It is merely one aspect of a more supportive ecosystem that we seek to build in helping employees manage both their work and family responsibilities.” She stressed the importance of other initiatives, such as subsidised care services and caregiver support networks. Ms Gan said tripartite guidelines will be introduced in 2024 on how employees can request FWAs, and how employers can manage such requests properly and fairly. The tripartite workgroup will study international practices and consult employers, human resource practitioners and employees in the next few months as it formulates the guidelines, she said.   \n",
       "5458  SINGAPORE – A $2.6 billion programme to renew the North-South and East-West MRT lines is slated to be mostly completed by December. Four of the six core systems have been upgraded – replacing sleepers that hold the running rail in place, changing the third rail that supplies traction power to trains, upgrading the signalling system, and renewing the power system. New concrete sleepers, which replace the badly worn wooden ones, ensure safer operation of trains. The third rail was the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011 that resulted in a Committee of Inquiry being convened. The new signalling system allows trains to run at 100-second intervals instead of the previous 120-second gaps – which will reduce crowding on trains as well as on station platforms. The glitchy power system had also caused Singapore’s biggest rail breakdown in 2015, which brought the North-South, East-West lines to a standstill during the evening rush hour of July 7. The new power system – completed in September 2023 – is expected to be more robust, and has sensors that can detect faults before they manifest into something serious. Work is still going on to replace the two lines’ track circuit system. This is due to be completed by December. Track circuits, along with the trains’ signalling system, are communication systems that ultimately prevent collision. Lastly, seven of 106 new trains ordered have entered service. The rest will be rolled out by 2026. When everything is in place, MRT users can expect swifter, safer and more dependable commutes, although industry watchers reckon that maintenance and renewal works never really end. For instance, sections of the steel rails which the trains run on are replaced as and when they are worn down, or when cracks are detected. But even with only the first three systems upgraded, the two oldest lines have been clocking more than one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) since 2019, compared with 70,000 MKBF and 60,000 MKBF on the North-South and East-West lines respectively in 2012 when the renewal programme started. MKBF – a measure of rail reliability – refers to the mean kilometres travelled between delays lasting more than five minutes. Spanning more than 100km, the two lines serve the most populated corridors of the island, with trains covering some 20 million train-km each year. Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat paid tribute to the men and women who made the renewal programme possible in a speech at Bishan Depot on Wednesday morning. He mentioned Mr Krishnasamy Kotaraju, a power supply engineer who has been with SMRT since 1988 and started out as an assistant maintenance engineer working with analogue components. “He reskilled himself through continuous education and training, and transitioned to the team that delivered the new power supply system, equipped with real-time condition monitoring capabilities,” Mr Chee said. The power supply renewal works encompassed the replacement of 1,300km of power cables, 250km of fibre-optic cables, and “hundreds of power transformers and switchboards”, he said. “The total length of all the power cables is equivalent to almost six times the length of Singapore’s coastline,” he said, adding that the new system has real-time fault detection and prediction so that operators can fix a flaw in a more timely fashion. Land Transport Authority (LTA) senior project manager Mohamad Ridhwan Abdul Lazim was also mentioned. His team worked on replacing the lines’ sleepers and third rails. “One of his key tasks was to closely coordinate the deployment of equipment and crew, and to carry out the works safely, while operating at night where visibility can be a challenge,” Mr Chee noted. Ms Wang Yizhen, an engineer from the LTA’s rolling stock team, went to China during “the height of Covid-19” to station herself at a train factory in Changchun to supervise the manufacturing and testing of trains. “They must have endured weeks of quarantine when they went to China, and quite possibly many rounds of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,” Mr Chee said, adding that Ms Wang was one of the first engineers deployed, and she spent more than six months in a single deployment there. Commuters welcomed the near completion of renewal works, which have spanned more than a decade. Programme manager Eugene Mok, 38, said he is especially looking forward to the newer trains. “The upgrading works seem to have resulted in noticeably shorter delays and breakdowns, and increased frequency of trains. But it would be even better if works can be done within the cabins to improve comfort levels for commuters. Sometimes the air-con is non-existent.” Ms Carrie Shum, a 28-year-old Hong Konger and communications professional who works here, said she had noticed that train journeys here take longer than in Hong Kong. “I am looking forward to a more efficient train ride,” she said, when told of the upgrading works. Author Jimmy Chua, 39, said: “It is good to have a new signalling system in place, so we can have shorter intervals between trains during peak hours. And a new power system that may prevent downtimes. And there are more empty spaces for wheelchairs and baby strollers on the newer trains. “I think commuters are happy when trains come regularly, are less crowded and the air-con is strong within the cabins.” Engineer Ng Guan Hong, 53, said: “Replacement of old trains and systems is part and parcel of the MRT maintenance programme. What I look forward to more is how the LTA can help to manage the cost on the passenger end, and not to transfer costs to users.” Completion of six core systems and cost: Replacement of rail wooden sleepers: Completed in December 2016 Replacement of third rail: Completed in September 2017, $370 million (together with re-sleepering) Upgrading of train signalling system: Completed in 2018, $195 million Replacement of power system: Completed in September 2023, $500 million Replacement of track circuit system: To be completed in December 2023, $73 million Replacement of older trains: 26 out of 106 new trains ordered have arrived. Seven have been put in service, with the rest slated to join them by 2026, $1.5 billion   \n",

At around 2.30pm, a red Rolls-Royce Dawn, a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a red Porsche 911 Targa and a white Toyota Alphard were removed by the police from the sprawling complex of more than 19,000 sq ft. The cars are worth over $4.7 million, according to an affidavit filed in September by a Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) officer. The GCB was rented by Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 35, who is one of the 10 accused in the case. The Straits Times saw one police vehicle in the bungalow and four tow trucks outside the compound. At least eight police officers were at the property. The first to be towed out was the Cullinan, followed by the Dawn, the Alphard, and then the Targa. Each of the four tow trucks had a police officer accompanying the driver. ST followed the seized vehicles to a logistics hub near Pioneer Road, where all four cars were parked. There were several other luxury vehicles parked in the same area, including a light blue Rolls-Royce. On Wednesday, the police said they seized items issued with prohibition of disposal orders relating to the money laundering case at two locations. Four cars and 56 Bearbrick ornaments were seized. The police did not say where the other location was. A Bearbrick – stylised as BE@RBRICK – is a collectible toy figure produced by Japanese collectible company Medicom Toy. The toys, shaped like an anthropomorphic bear and made of plastic, come in different sizes – for instance, 100 per cent, 400 per cent or 1,000 per cent – with the percentage corresponding with the height. Mr Shawn Wee, the owner of collectibles store Eye For Toys, had told ST in August that the Bearbricks seized in the raids could be worth between $450,000 and $500,000. The police said: “As part of the investigation process, the police are moving the seized items to appropriate locations to prevent tampering, loss, destruction or any other occurrence which may diminish their evidentiary value.” The cars were among the 62 vehicles and 152 properties issued with prohibition of disposal orders by the authorities. This means they cannot be sold. The vehicles and properties are worth more than $1.24 billion. The case is also considered one of the world’s largest money laundering cases. The police had said in August that Su was arrested at his residence in Third Avenue. He faces four money laundering charges. On Oct 18, prosecutors said he had claimed to be the chief executive of a computer support firm, but did not know where his office was. In fact, investigations show that this firm, An Xing Technology, is a shell company, said the prosecution in arguing against granting him bail. The CAD officer’s affidavit had said more than $231 million worth of assets belonging to Su and his wife have been seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. They include 13 real estate properties worth over $115 million, four vehicles worth over $4.7 million, $18.4 million in cash, $66 million in bank accounts and $26 million worth of cryptocurrency. According to an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority search, Su has another registered address at a St Thomas Walk condominium. He is wanted in China for alleged links to an illegal gambling gang uncovered in 2017. Another of the accused, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, is wanted for his part in the same operation. This is the second time this week that ST has seen items being moved out from GCBs linked to the accused individuals in the money laundering case. On Monday at around 2pm, ST saw workers packing items into cardboard boxes at a GCB in Nassim Road. The pallets were then moved into a truck at about 6.10pm, leaving the area 10 minutes later. Su Baolin, who faces two forgery charges, had rented the GCB in Nassim Road with his wife Ma Ning. There were several cars parked on the street during the operation. ST also saw plain-clothes police officers there. Last Wednesday, ST saw items being removed from another GCB in Bishopsgate, off Tanglin Road, by movers. The house is rented by another accused – Vang Shuiming, or Wang Shuiming – and his wife Wang Ruiyan. Vang faces four money laundering charges and one charge of using a forged document. The items, which included one pallet of about 50 bottles of Macallan 25 Years Sherry Oak whisky, were loaded into an air-conditioned truck. Each bottle of the whisky costs between $4,000 and $5,000. The truck, which was escorted by the same car present in Nassim Road on Monday, then travelled to Le Freeport Singapore, a high-security storage facility in Changi North Crescent. It is touted as the safest area in Singapore for wealth protection. Shin Min Daily News had reported last Friday that a number of other assets, including a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley, were also transported from the Bishopsgate house. Plain-clothes police officers entered the property and remained there for about four hours. An anti-money laundering operation on Aug 15 involved more than 400 police officers and saw raids at properties in areas such as Tanglin, Bukit Timah, Orchard Road, Sentosa and River Valley. Ten foreigners, all originally from China, were charged the next day with offences including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.   \n",

Last Friday, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled that Mr Yap Ee Guan’s death on July 13, 2022, was a work-related misadventure. Ruling out foul play, the coroner said he wholeheartedly endorsed recommendations made by the Workplace Safety and Health Council following the accident. These included the use of camera technology by stakeholders to observe the pile-driving analysis test, which would allow them to be stationed much farther away. According to the coroner’s report, Mr Yap was working for Takenaka Corp. Since July 1, 2022, He had been deployed to a worksite in Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, where two fabrication blocks, an office block and four blocks of ancillary facilities were being constructed. Takenaka had contracted BBR Piling to carry out piling works, and the latter firm was required to carry out pile tests. On July 6, 2022, Mr Yap had been present at the worksite to witness the pile-driving analysis test – which is used to evaluate the integrity of piles. As part of the test, a hammer is released from a height to fall onto a pile, upon which plywood can be placed to cushion the pile from the impact and prevent damage to it. After the hammer was dropped during the test that day, the plywood shattered and a large, triangular fragment of the wood, measuring 73cm by 57cm, flew to the rest area, 26m away. “I found that the fragment of plywood that was flung away from the test was a large fragment and could have posed a danger to multiple people had they been in its flight path,” said State Coroner Nakhoda. The fragment hit Mr Yap’s face and head, inflicting what the coroner described as devastating injuries. The 51-year-old was bleeding from his face, and despite being conscious, was unable to open his eyes. He was taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital, where he underwent surgery. He suffered bleeding on the surface of his brain, fractures to one of his eye sockets, and ruptures of both his eyes. Despite the surgery and treatment to manage his injuries, his condition worsened. His family was told that further surgery could be performed, but that it came with risks and might not improve the condition of his brain. A decision was made to take him off life support. Mr Yap died on July 13, 2022. The coroner found that during the pile-driving analysis test, the risk assessment and safe work procedure control measures of demarcating the hammer drop area and barricading the test area had not been adhered to. But he said that even if this was done, it would not necessarily have prevented the accident as the barricades were meant to keep personnel out of the test area and were not intended to stop fragments from the test flying out of the area. The coroner also noted that the thickness of the piece of plywood was greater than required in BBR’s document for the correct procedures, safety precautions and work requirements of the project.  However, he said that it had not been established whether the increased thickness of the plywood would have contributed to it shattering and a large fragment being expelled explosively. The coroner said he accepted the Ministry of Manpower’s lead investigator’s evidence that the accident was an unexpected occurrence, adding that none of the personnel that the investigator interviewed had reported seeing a fragment of plywood traverse such a distance during a test. “Usually, if the plywood shattered during the test, the broken piece would fall next to the bored pile and not be explosively shot out as it was in this case,” the report said. The coroner urged stakeholders to implement other safety measures to ensure that accidents of this nature are not repeated. He said: “Shatter-proof cushioning material would significantly reduce the chance of a similar accident. If such cushioning materials are not available, then the test area should be surrounded with barricades, such as Perspex sheets, that can contain any fragments expelled following the test. “A pile drive cap could also have been placed over the pile to, similarly, contain the risk of fragments being expelled.”   \n",
